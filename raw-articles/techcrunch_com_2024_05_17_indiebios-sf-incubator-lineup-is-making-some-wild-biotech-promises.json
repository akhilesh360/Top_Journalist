We took special note of a few, which were making some major, bordering on ludicrous, claims that could pay off in a big way.\n\nBiotech has been creeping out in recent years to touch adjacent industries, as companies find how much they rely on outdated processes or even organisms to get things done. So it may not surprise you that there\u2019s a microbiome company in the latest batch \u2014 but you might be surprised when you hear it\u2019s the microbiome of copper ore.\n\nI talked with IndieBio\u2019s chief science officer, Wes Dang, about the companies I found most promising or provocative, and he assured me that despite sounding somewhat outlandish, these companies are serious and the IndieBio program does a lot of verification work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all technical by background, several PhDs, including myself \u2014 we do the diligence together. We all look at the papers, and some of us go deep and check the figures and assumptions,\u201d he said.\n\nStream Genomics is perhaps the most easily grasped of the new group: a genome sequencing method and device that is faster and cheaper than runaway market leader Illumina, and more importantly reduces the need for wet-lab prep that still takes a lot of time and expertise.\n\nImage Credits:Stream Genomics\n\nThere are cheaper sequencers out there, but because Illumina is so deeply embedded, the cost of switching is high, especially if you\u2019re only saving money on the sequencing step. Stream Genomics\u2019 approach minimizes sample prep and reagents used (the sequencing isn\u2019t cyclic) while shifting a lot of the computational load to the cloud. They say it\u2019s orders of magnitude quicker and cheaper.\n\n\u201cWith Stream, you\u2019re just watching the nucleotides incorporate in real time, looking at the colors associated with the As, Ts, Gs, and Cs coming up, and doing it without a huge computational load,\u201d said Dang. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of streaming versus download a Blu-ray.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The specifics are certainly in the weeds, but the company is planning to sell just the material to battery makers who already have the means to make batteries of this type but need the silicon mixture \u2014 \u201cBasically a slurry,\u201d said Dang \u2014 which Aqualith makes exclusively.\n\nAs you can see, the AquaLith thing (right) is smoother. Image Credits:Aqualith\n\nBattery startups and alternative chemistries have come and gone for decades, and only a small portion end up being anything but a footnote; however, AquaLith is apparently solving for a very specific problem in an otherwise noncontroversial part of the domain. They have plans to make a nonflammable battery cell soon as well. Here\u2019s hoping it works out.\n\nFarm Minerals is starting its journey off with a bit of good old-fashioned stunt advertising: It\u2019s giving away the first million acres\u2019 worth of its synthetic fertilizer for free. \u201cThey\u2019re basically doing it as a sort of flex,\u201d said Dang. \u201cIt\u2019s just so incredibly cheap to make.\u201d\n\nElectron microscope image of the high-surface-area structure of the mineral additive. Image Credits:Farm Minerals\n\nFertilizer is a huge expense for farming and you need tons of it to cover a good-size field. But ultimately crops need only a small amount of the minerals in it \u2014 so Farm Minerals is encapsulating those minerals in a special super-bioavailable carbon casing. They say that 160 grams of it is enough for \u2014 checks notes \u2014 2 million hectares?!\n\n\u201cAs a scientist, I was like, no fucking way this works,\u201d Dang said after I offered a similarly blue appraisal. But they looked into it and apparently it does. Also, that means they\u2019re giving away about a cereal bowl\u2019s worth of product for the stunt. Suddenly that part doesn\u2019t seem so wild. That jug in the image above is probably enough to cover the whole country. We\u2019ll follow up with the company soon to see about independent validation of these claims.\n\nImage Credits:Transition Biomining\n\nTransition Biomining may be the most sci-fi of the companies, trying, as they describe it, \u201cto squeeze life out of a rock.\u201d The issue is this: Only a certain amount of the minerals in raw ore can be easily collected through the physical and chemical processes (already quite extreme and caustic) currently used. What\u2019s better than getting 95% of the copper out of five gigatons of ore? Getting 98% of it. (I\u2019m inventing these numbers.) And if Transition\u2019s method works, someone else will be doing the work: microbes.\n\nThe company aims to test and understand the microbiome of the rock \u2014 that is, the unique set of microbes living in and around it \u2014 and modify it so that minerals are being extracted by those microbes just doing their thing. It won\u2019t replace the acid baths and other traditional methods, but it might help make mines more efficient.\n\nThere are plenty more in the batch. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of the others:\n\nAble Sciences: Self-amplifying RNA that lowers the cost of cell therapy.\n\nBryosphere: Treatment for age spots made in a moss cell reactor.\n\nHypercell: Simple, fast food safety testing for industrial packing facilities.\n\nNutrition From Water: Low-carbon whey sourced from aquaculture.\n\nSpiralWave: Plug-and-play cold plasma methanol reactor.\n\nReactosome: Gene delivery via a supplementary nucleus (!).\n\nRybodyn: Finds and characterizes unknown proteins from the \u201cdark proteome.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Organic: Organic ammonia supplier via fermentation.\n\nCereswaves: \u201cElectrofertilizer\u201d that boosts crop and animal growth with energy field (?).\n\nOxyle: Mechanical(ish) PFAS removal from ground and waste water.\n\nWe\u2019ll want to follow up with these companies as they share more about their progress toward these sometimes mad-sounding ambitions. The San Francisco\u2013based incubator\u2019s demo day will be in June, at which time the companies may have more information to share."}
