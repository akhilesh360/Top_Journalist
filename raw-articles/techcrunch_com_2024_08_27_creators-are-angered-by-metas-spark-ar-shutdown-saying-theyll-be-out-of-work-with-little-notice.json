In posts published to the Meta Spark Community on Facebook, creators are posting about their disappointment in Meta\u2019s decision, noting that for some of them, the move will put them out of work \u2014 and they only learned this from a Facebook post this morning. Others seem either confused or angry about the plan to close Spark and are demanding to know the reasoning behind the company\u2019s move.\n\nOn the Meta Spark website, the company said it will be shutting down its platform of third-party AR tools and content effective Tuesday, January 14, 2025. After that point, the AR effects built by brands and AR creators will no longer be available for use. Those built and owned by Meta will remain available across Meta\u2019s family of apps, however.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply grateful to the community of creators, businesses, and other key stakeholders who have been part of the Meta Spark journey,\u201d according to the announcement. \u201cWhen we first launched this platform seven years ago, experiences infused with augmented reality were new to most consumers. Since then, the imagination, innovation, and creativity of our AR creator community has helped extend the reach of AR to hundreds of millions of people across Meta\u2019s platforms.\u201d\n\nFirst launched in 2017, Meta Spark debuted when augmented reality experiences were still relatively novel and new to many consumers. Since then, the AR effects have been used \u201cbillions of times\u201d by \u201chundreds of millions of Meta users,\u201d the company said in the announcement. The sizable traction had made Meta Spark one of the largest AR platforms at the time.\n\nIn addition to building effects for Facebook and Instagram, the program expanded in 2021 with the ability to build AR effects for video calls on Messenger, Instagram and (the now discontinued) Portal devices. At that time, the company said more than 600,000 creators from over 190 countries had built AR effects using its tools.\n\nMeta suggested its decision wasn\u2019t related to the platform\u2019s adoption or traction, saying the decision to shut down Spark was made \u201cfollowing a thorough assessment\u201d and that the move will allow Meta to \u201cprioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and businesses alike.\u201d Likely the products Meta aims to now prioritize are those associated with its AI tools and initiatives, though the company didn\u2019t say that directly.\n\nMeta may have more news about what\u2019s next for developers at its upcoming Meta Connect event scheduled to kick off September 25 in Menlo Park. Of particular interest is that Meta is rumored to be working on an updated version of its AR smart glasses that will differ from its current Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. Given the tech giant\u2019s reported interest in AR technologies, it\u2019s somewhat odd for it to shutter a program that catered to fostering AR development while risking the ire of its developers.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

You can\u2019t just abruptly end support for filters in such a simple and easy way \u2014 it\u2019s a huge disrespect to us and also to the Facebook/Instagram users, most of whom continue using the platform because of these effects. Five months to end development? It should be at least a year so that we creators can have a better opportunity to build a new portfolio or find a new job. This is inadmissible. I sincerely hope you reconsider this absurd idea of shutting down the platform.\u201d\n\nCosta\u2019s post was followed by a poll about the shutdown. (Unsurprisingly, most creators voted that Meta shouldn\u2019t end Meta Spark.)\n\nMeta recommends that AR creators who have published effects to Instagram, Facebook or Messenger should download and save their project files, assets and demos before the shutdown date of January 14. The company said it will also archive the Meta Spark Community group after this date as well."}
