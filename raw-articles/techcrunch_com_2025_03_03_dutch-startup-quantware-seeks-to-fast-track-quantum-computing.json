But although all of these can be considered to be breakthroughs, quantum startups often focus on more practical advancements \u2014 and they are making progress.\n\nFounded in 2020, Dutch startup QuantWare is one of these, which claims that the hardware it manufactures already powers quantum computers for customers in 20 countries. Its core offering, VIO, focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs).\n\nEveryone in the quantum computing field is striving for more qubits, the quantum equivalent of bits \u2014 but integrating more qubits on a single chip is more powerful and less error-prone than networking several smaller systems together. QuantWare\u2019s proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, \u201cis the missing link in scaling up QPUs,\u201d according to its CEO, Matthijs Rijlaarsdam.\n\nA spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech, QuantWare has now raised a \u20ac20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) \u2014 including the \u20ac5 million equity portion of the \u20ac7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council after its \u20ac6 million seed round (the remaining part is a grant).\n\nEuropean funding aside, this all-equity round was co-led by Dutch state-owned entity Invest-NL Deep Tech Fund and regional economic development agency InnovationQuarter, solidifying QuantWare\u2019s position as a frontrunner in the Netherlands\u2019 growing quantum ecosystem.\n\nThe new funds will be used to scale QuantWare\u2019s team and technology, which was also recently updated: In February, the startup announced it would accept preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction.\n\nWhile Google\u2019s Willow processor brought quantum error correction into the spotlight, QuantWare aims for a roadmap-focused strategy. It\u2019s designed for upgradability to larger VIO-powered QPUs, and Contralto-A\u2019s claim to fame is that it is \u201calmost twice as large as competing solutions that are commercially available.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But from the perspective of startups that risk not surviving long without revenues, the race is also about making quantum hardware commercially accessible to all \u2014 sooner than later.\n\nOn that front, QuantWare is pursuing two paths: Distributing its own designed QPUs, and allowing other companies to use its technology via its Foundry and Packaging Services. The new funding will also be deployed in these two directions \u2014 further developing VIO and building out its chip-fabrication facilities.\n\nIn addition to research institutes, users include several well-funded quantum startups, such as Alice & Bob, which recently raised $104 million. Two of these \u2014 Quantum Machines, which raised $170 million last month, and SEEQC, which announced $30 million in new funding in January \u2014 are also working together with the Dutch startup on the development of technology and products.\n\nIt is too early to tell which of these companies, if any, will come up with a quantum architecture that can provide a million qubits; Microsoft is in this race, too, and estimated that its Majorana announcement puts that horizon \u201cwithin years, not decades.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake, Rijlaarsdam told TechCrunch, is the ability for quantum to solve meaningful, industrial-scale problems.\n\n\u201cThere is a large and valuable class of problems that even a gigawatt AI cluster will not be able to solve \u2014 but quantum computers will,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we are building these systems. Some examples include calculations on quantum systems, such as creating better materials, discovering new catalysts to break down microplastics, or improving the sustainability of fertilizer.\u201d\n\nBut for QuantWare, which believes in quantum open architecture, the question is not who will build these million qubit systems; with VIO, it just wants to do its part in pushing for it to happen quickly."}
