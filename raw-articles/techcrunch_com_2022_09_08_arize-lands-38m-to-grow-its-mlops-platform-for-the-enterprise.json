Bringing Arize\u2019s total capital raised to $62 million, CEO Jason Lopatecki says that the new cash will be used to scale R&D and double the company\u2019s 50-person headcount over the next year.\n\nMachine learning operations, or MLOps, has to do with deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production. Similar to DevOps, MLOps aims to increase automation while improving the quality of production models \u2014 but not at the expense of business and regulatory requirements. Given the interest in machine learning and AI more broadly in the enterprise, it\u2019s no surprise that MLOps is projected to become a large market, with IDC putting the size at around $700 million by 2025.\n\nArize was founded in 2019 by Lopatecki and Aparna Dhinakaran, after Lopatecki sold a previous startup \u2014 TubeMogul \u2014 to Adobe for around $550 million. Lopatecki and Dhinakaran first met at TubeMogul, in fact, where Dhinakaran was a data scientist prior to joining Uber to work on machine learning infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAfter watching team after team \u2014 year after year \u2014 fail to understand both what was wrong with models delivered into production and struggle to understand what models were doing once deployed, we came to the conclusion that something was fundamentally missing,\u201d Lopatecki told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cIf the future is AI-driven, then there needs to be software to help humans understand AI, break down problems and fix them. AI without machine learning observability isn\u2019t sustainable.\u201d\n\nArize certainly isn\u2019t the first to tackle these sorts of challenges in data science. Another MLOps vendor, Tecton, recently raised $100 million to build out its machine learning model experimentation platform. Other players in the space include Galileo, Modular, Gantry and Grid.ai, the last of which secured $40 million in June to launch a gallery of components that add AI capabilities to apps.\n\nBut Lopatecki claims that Arize is unique in several aspects. The first is a focus on observability: Arize\u2019s embeddings product is designed to look inside deep learning models and understand their structure. \u201cBias Tracing\u201d complements it, a tool that monitors for bias in models (e.g., facial recognition models that recognize Black people less often than subjects with lighter skin) \u2014 and attempts to trace back to the data causing the bias.\n\nMost recently, Arize debuted embedding drift monitoring, which tries to detect when models become less accurate as a result of outdated training data. For example, drift monitoring might alert an Arize customer if a language model answered \u201cDonald Trump\u201d in response to the question \u201cWho\u2019s the current U.S. president?\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cArize stands out \u2026 [because] we\u2019re laser-focused on doing one difficult thing well: machine learning observability,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cUltimately, we believe machine learning infrastructure will look like software infrastructure with a number of market-leading, best-of-breed solutions used by machine learning engineers to build great machine learning.\u201d\n\nArize\u2019s second differentiator, Lopatecki says, is its domain expertise. Both he and Dhinakaran hail from academia and draw from practitioner roots, he notes \u2014 having built machine learning infrastructure and managed problems with models in production.\n\n\u201cEven for teams that are experts and thought leaders, it\u2019s becoming impossible to keep up with every new model architecture and every new breakthrough,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cJust as quickly as teams are finished building their latest model, they are typically leaping onto the next model the business needs. This leaves little time for deep introspection of the billions of decisions these models are making on a daily basis and the impact these models have on both businesses and people \u2026 That\u2019s why Arize spent over a year building a product to monitor deep learning models and designed workflows to troubleshoot where they go wrong.\u201d\n\nSome might argue (correctly) that Arize\u2019s competitors have experts among their ranks as well, and observability and monitoring solutions in their product suites. But judging by Arize\u2019s impressive client list, the startup is making one heck of a convincing sales pitch. Uber, Spotify, eBay, Etsy, Instacart, P&G, TransUnion, Nextdoor, Stitch Fix and Chick-fil-A are among Arize\u2019s paying customers, and the company\u2019s free tier \u2014 which launched earlier this year \u2014 has over 1,000 users.\n\nMum\u2019s the word on annual recurring revenue, however. Lopatecki was adamant the capital from the Series B will give the company \u201cample runway,\u201d macroenvironment be darned.\n\n\u201cIn healthcare, there are teams using Arize to ensure that cancer detection models using images are consistent in production across a wide spread of cancer types. Additionally, there are teams using Arize to ensure the models used in standard of care decisions and the insurance experience are consistent across racial groups,\u201d Lopatecki added. \u201cAs models get more complex, we\u2019re seeing that even the largest and most sophisticated machine learning teams are realizing they would rather invest their time and energy in building better models rather than building a machine learning observability tool \u2026 Arize helps practitioners improve the return on investment of models and quantify the results for business leaders [and provides] the market-leading software to monitor the risks of AI investments.\u201d"}
