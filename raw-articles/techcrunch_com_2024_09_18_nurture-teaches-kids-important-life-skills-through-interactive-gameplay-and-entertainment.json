Nurture is a new app designed for children aged 4 to 7 that features interactive content and games to capture their interest. The company\u2019s mission is to equip children with critical life skills such as socializing, basic financial understanding, mindfulness, fitness, nutrition, and more through story-based adventures that kids can actively participate in.\n\nNurture announced Wednesday its $2.8 million pre-seed round, led by Golden Gate Ventures, with participation from Club Penguin co-founder Lance Priebe. The funding will go toward bringing on preschool content creators to help develop content for the platform.\n\nThe flagship title that Nurture first launched is called \u201cDoki\u2019s Delivery\u201d and is focused on helping kids learn social-emotional skills. The series follows a group of characters who are on a mission to deliver an egg in a spaceship.\n\nImage Credits:Nurture\n\nThe app also has a dual-screen component that requires parents to download the Nurture TV app on Fire TV or Google TV so kids can interact between both screens. For \u201cDoki\u2019s Delivery,\u201d kids can use their phone or tablet as a game controller while playing on the TV screen. They can tilt the mobile device from side to side to help the characters avoid obstacles.\n\nOther interactions include answering a call from the main character, designing the spaceship, and hatching the mysterious egg, which players can then take care of \u2014 similar to Tamagotchi, the popular toy.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make it passive, mindless screen time. I want to make it an active, interactive learning experience,\u201d co-founder and CEO Roger Egan told TechCrunch. \u201c[Once kids] get the concepts, then we use the games and interactives to practice the skills and apply them.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to release new original content focusing on \u201cgrowth mindset and financial thinking,\u201d as explained by Egan. Additionally, Nurture is in discussions with around 20 popular third-party creators to enhance its content library. Nurture\u2019s creator platform enables creators to host content on their own digital \u201cislands,\u201d which users can access by swiping through the app menu.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Having a front-row seat to his children\u2019s education, he believed that traditional schooling doesn\u2019t adequately prepare kids for the rapidly changing world, especially one powered by AI. In his opinion, children should also learn things like adaptability, critical thinking, digital literacy, mindfulness, and empathy to thrive in the future. However, he struggled to find suitable alternatives to complement his kids\u2019 education.\n\nEgan previously founded the online grocer RedMart, which was acquired by Alibaba. He is joined by co-founders Danny Limanseta (chief product officer), who served as product design lead at RedMart; Sally Doherty (chief people officer), who previously worked at Microsoft; and Scott and Julie Stewart (chief creative officers), a husband and wife team who specialize in children\u2019s animated content, such as \u201cLego Friends: The Next Chapter.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Nurture\n\nIn addition to Priebe being an investor, he\u2019s also a game design advisor for Nurture. Priebe was responsible for creating Club Penguin, an incredibly popular multiplayer online game.\n\n\u201cThe next generation of kids are picking up games faster than watching a show,\u201d Priebe told us. \u201cI really like the idea of you\u2019re not just going to sit there and watch linear TV anymore. \u2026 It\u2019s really novel, how the [Nurture] characters stop and bring the kid into the adventure, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Now what would you do?\u2019 or \u2018How would you want us to do this?\u2019\u201d\n\nCurrently, Nurture is an invite-only beta available for users in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. It plans to expand to other markets in 2025. The company will also launch a paid subscription once the app is open to the public.\n\nOther participants in the round include Reach Capital and Seedcamp. Other notable advisers include Manuel Bronstein, Roblox\u2019s chief product officer; Scott Kraft, former lead writer and executive producer of \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d; and Joey Mazzarino, the puppeteer on \u201cSesame Street\u201d known for his roles as Murray Monster, Stinky the Stinkweed, and other Muppets."}
