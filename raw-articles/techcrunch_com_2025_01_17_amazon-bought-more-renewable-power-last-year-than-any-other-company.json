That\u2019s over 10 gigawatts more than its nearest competitor, Apple.\n\nThe additions made Amazon the largest corporate purchaser of renewable power, according to BloombergNEF. The company\u2019s total portfolio is split roughly evenly between utility-scale wind and solar farms and on-site solar power projects. In total, it\u2019s enough to power 8.3 million homes, Amazon said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s renewable and storage contracts have allowed it to reduce emissions from purchased electricity, so-called Scope 2 emissions, even as it has ramped up its data centers.\n\nStill, the company has a long way to go to eliminating its carbon footprint. Like many companies, the vast majority of Amazon\u2019s emissions come from Scope 3, which covers activities over which it exercises less control. That includes outlays like air travel, leased buildings, and building construction.\n\nAccording to Amazon\u2019s 2023 sustainability report, total emissions peaked in 2021 after rising sharply for many years. Its carbon intensity \u2014 a measure of greenhouse gas emissions divided by gross sales \u2014 has also been declining. (Carbon intensity is a metric favored by fast growing organizations, since they tend to consume more fossil fuels as they grow. If they invest in zero-carbon power, carbon intensity tends to grow more slowly or decline relative to overall emissions, telling a more positive story.)\n\nAmazon has yet to release its 2024 sustainability report, which would give a more complete picture of the company\u2019s progress toward its 2040 net zero goal."}
