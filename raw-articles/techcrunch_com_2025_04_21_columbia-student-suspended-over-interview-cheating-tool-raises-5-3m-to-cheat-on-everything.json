It offers its users the chance to \u201ccheat\u201d on things like exams, sales calls, and job interviews thanks to a hidden in-browser window that can\u2019t be viewed by the interviewer or test giver.\n\nCluely has published a manifesto comparing itself to inventions like the calculator and spellcheck, which were originally derided as \u201ccheating.\u201d\n\nCluely also published a slickly produced, but polarizing, launch video of Lee using a hidden AI assistant to (unsuccessfully) lie to a woman about his age, and even his knowledge of art, on a date at a fancy restaurant:\n\nCluely is out. cheat on everything. pic.twitter.com/EsRXQaCfUI \u2014 Roy (@im_roy_lee) April 20, 2025\n\nWhile some praised the video for grabbing people\u2019s attention, others derided it as reminiscent of the dystopian sci-fi television show \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d:\n\nImagine making a black mirror short as a product ad https://t.co/2GKXQj8e1v \u2014 Cody Blakeney (@code_star) April 21, 2025\n\nLee, who is Cluely\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch the AI cheating tool surpassed $3 million in ARR earlier this month.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Shanmugam was also embroiled in disciplinary proceedings at Columbia over the AI tool. Both co-founders have dropped out of Columbia, the university\u2019s student newspaper reported last week. Columbia declined to comment, citing student privacy laws.\n\nCluely began as a tool for developers to cheat on knowledge of LeetCode, a platform for coding questions that some in software engineering circles \u2014 including Cluely\u2019s founders, of course \u2014 consider outdated and a waste of time.\n\nLee says he was able to snag an internship with Amazon using the AI cheating tool. Amazon declined to comment on Lee\u2019s particular case to TechCrunch, but said its job candidates must acknowledge they won\u2019t use unauthorized tools during the interview process.\n\nCluely isn\u2019t the only controversial AI startup launched this month. Earlier, a famed AI researcher announced his own startup with the stated mission of replacing all human workers everywhere, causing a brouhaha of its own on X."}
