You probably recommended it to all your friends. And what do you get for that? Just more retargeted ads,\u201d she said.\n\nKiki is flipping that model by allowing its community members to vote on the features they want before the beauty products are made. As a reward, voters earn points toward free products and receive digital tokens in the company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic that the internet and your bathroom have not seen yet,\u201d Bobosikova said. (She may be right about the bathroom, though of course, the internet has seen plenty of customers vote on products and earn digital tokens for their participation.)\n\nSince it\u2019s not uncommon for cosmetics companies to find themselves with large piles of inventory they can\u2019t sell, another benefit of Kiki\u2019s on-demand approach is that it uses less capital and resources.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Users can sign in with an email, and voila, Kiki has created an on-chain account that will store the members\u2019 votes into perpetuity.\n\na16z decided to back Kiki after the startup completed its 10-week crypto startup accelerator program. \u201cJana is a force of nature. She was one of the things that most drew us to the company,\u201d said Arianna Simpson, a general partner at the firm. \u201cShe has incredible expertise in the beauty space, but also a unique understanding of web3, which is not always something we see if we have a founder coming out of a more traditional industry.\u201d\n\nPrior to founding Kiki, the Czech-born Bobosikova was the CEO of Epic Future Labs, a product development and brand innovations agency.\n\nSimpson noted that Kiki is not the firm\u2019s only bet on a company that rewards customers using blockchain technology. Last year, a16z led a $24 million Series A of Blackbird Labs, a hospitality tech company that developed a loyalty program that incentivizes guests to dine in independent restaurants.\n\nFor now, Kiki has launched five product collections, including a nail polish pen, for which consumers can choose the next color Kiki will manufacture.\n\nBut, as Simpson pointed out, Kiki has plans to eventually expand beyond the world of beauty.\n\nHow long will it be until it\u2019s possible to vote on jeans styles or purse sizes? Perhaps a while.\n\n\u201cWe have faced insane challenges on the physical side of things,\u201d Bobosikova said, adding that some products take much longer to manufacture than others. \u201cThe power of asking people what they want and giving it to them, it\u2019s very, very simple. It\u2019s just very hard to do.\u201d"}
