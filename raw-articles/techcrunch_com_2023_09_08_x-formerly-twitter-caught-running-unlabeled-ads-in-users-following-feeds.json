While scrolling the Following feed on a Mac using the Chrome web browser, we encountered a handful of unlabeled ads amid other posts from people we follow, as well as other ads that did properly display the \u201cAd\u201d label at the top right of the post.\n\nBecause many of X\u2019s ads are still labeled, this makes the unlabeled ones even harder to spot.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the issue is a glitch with X\u2019s advertising platform or a deliberate change intended to deceive consumers into believing some ads are regular posts from accounts they follow.\n\nIn our tests, we came across a good handful of unlabeled ads from accounts we didn\u2019t follow. In fact, the only indication they were an ad was by clicking on the three-dot menu at the top-right of the post. When you click this menu on an ad, you\u2019re presented with various engagement options like \u201cNot interested in this ad\u201d or \u201cWhy this ad?\u201d as well as tools to follow the account, mute it, block it and more.\n\nIn some cases, the unlabeled ads were from various NFL teams \u2014 according to examples sent in by a tipster \u2014 but TechCrunch also found a variety of other posts that were not displaying the ad label when we attempted to reproduce the problem ourselves. (This took a lot of scrolling and clicking!)\n\nThe issue with the ads follows an update X made to its ad labeling format in July, which saw it switching from a more prominent \u201cPromoted\u201d label at the bottom of its ads which had also included an arrow icon right above the post\u2019s interaction buttons like reply and retweet.\n\nNow, the word \u201cAd\u201d appears on the top-right of a post, next to the poster\u2019s name and @username \u2014 a placement that some critics said made the ads less noticeable.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The attempt to disguise ads as content smacks of financial desperation \u2014 not the best way to convey a \u2018brand safe\u2019 site for advertisers!\u201d Chester added.\n\nIt appears the unlabeled ads may be an ongoing issue, as we came across a few posts that referenced the problem before today.\n\n\u201cA user\u2019s control of their social media experience must include clear labeling of ads they did not seek, as distinct from content they did seek,\u201d noted Adam Schwartz, the Senior Staff Attorney at digital privacy nonprofit EFF. \u201cIf a platform is failing to label ads, it should correct this problem.\u201d\n\nWho was looking for screenshots of ads in the timeline not being labeled as ads in an open and shut FTC violation? pic.twitter.com/6C6zDKoV2Y \u2014 You Gotta Give (@you_gotta_give) September 7, 2023\n\nJust got an ad pushed to my feed that *was not labeled as an ad* pic.twitter.com/RwJMYvxGVj \u2014 Big Tobacco St. William (@CorrectWord) September 7, 2023\n\nWe've reached the point where Blue Check posts that are not labeled as ads *for accounts I do not follow* are showing up in my \"Following\" tab. pic.twitter.com/hepj5mx3LV \u2014 Warren J. Wells, AICP \ud83d\udeb4\ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f\ud83e\udd80 (@WarrenJWells) September 6, 2023\n\nSo now we're getting ads in the Twitter timeline that aren't even labeled as \"Ad.\" I am not following the Jaguars. pic.twitter.com/Iso9YXCfpM \u2014 el jefe (@ThatElJefe) September 1, 2023\n\nIn addition to potentially attracting the attention of the FTC or another regulatory investigation beyond the U.S., the flub with ad labeling is also a prominent stain on the resume of X\u2019s newly hired CEO Linda Yaccarino, who joined the company in June from NBCUniversal where she had been chairman of its advertising and partnerships group. Her hiring was meant to signal to advertisers that a responsible adult who understood the business had been put in charge of the revenue-generating side of the Elon Musk-owned company.\n\nSince Yaccarino\u2019s hire, X has tried to lure back advertisers with a $250 ad credit and promises that advertisers could choose their own \u201csensitivity\u201d settings when it came to brand safety. More recently, though, Elon Musk began blaming the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s (ADL) accusations of antisemitism for X\u2019s declining U.S. advertising revenues and threatened a lawsuit against the organization.\n\nX no longer has a communications department that responds to press inquiries.\n\nNevertheless, we reached out to X for comment and received an automated email response that read: \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d Previously, the company would respond to inquiries using the poop emoji."}
