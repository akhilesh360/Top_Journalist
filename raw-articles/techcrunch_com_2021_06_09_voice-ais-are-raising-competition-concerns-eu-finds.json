Today it\u2019s put out a first report discussing potential concerns that EU lawmakers say will help inform their wider digital policymaking in the coming years.\n\nA major piece of EU legislation introduced at the back of last year is already set to apply ex ante regulations to so-called \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platforms operating in the region, with a list of business practice \u201cdos and don\u2019ts\u201d for powerful, intermediating platforms being baked into the forthcoming pan-EU Digital Services Act.\n\nBut of course applications of technology don\u2019t stand still. The bloc\u2019s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has also had her eye on voice assistant AI technologies for a while \u2014 raising concerns about the challenges being posed for user choice as far back as 2019, when she said her department was \u201ctrying to figure out how access to data will change the marketplace\u201d.\n\nThe Commission took a concrete step last July when it announced a sectoral inquiry to examine IoT competition concerns in detail.\n\nIt\u2019s now published a preliminary report, based on polling more than 200 companies operating in consumer IoT product and services markets (in Europe, Asia and the U.S.) \u2014 and is soliciting further feedback on the findings (until September 1) ahead of a final report due in the first half of next year.\n\nAmong the main areas of potential competition concern it found are: Exclusivity and tying practices in relation to voice assistants and practices that limit the possibility to use different voice assistants on the same smart device; the intermediating role of voice assistants and mobile OSes between users and the wider device and services market \u2014 with the concern being this allows the owners of the platform voice AI to control user relationships, potentially impacting the discoverability and visibility of rival IoT services.\n\nAnother concern is around (unequal) access to data. Survey participants suggested that platform and voice assistant operators gain extensive access to user data \u2014 including capturing information on user interactions with third-party smart devices and consumer IoT services as a result of the intermediating voice AI.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But it\u2019s noteworthy that the Commission is trying to get a handle on competitive risks \u2014 and start mulling potential remedies \u2014 at a point when the adoption of voice assistant AIs is still at a relatively early stage in the region.\n\nIn its press release, the Commission notes that usage of voice assistant tech is growing worldwide and expected to double between 2020 and 2024 (from 4.2 billion voice AIs to 8.4 billion) \u2014 although only 11% of EU citizens surveyed last year had already used a voice assistant, per cited Eurostat data.\n\nEU lawmakers have certainly learned lessons from the recent failure of competition policy to keep up with digital developments and rein in a first wave of tech giants. And those giants of course continue to dominate the market for voice AIs now (Amazon with Alexa, Google with its eponymous Assistant and Apple\u2019s Siri). So the risks for competition are crystal clear \u2014 and the Commission will be keen to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.\n\nStill, quite how policymakers could look to tackle competitive lock-in around voice AIs \u2014 whose USP tends to be their lazy-web, push-button and branded convenience for users \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\nOne option, enforcing interoperability, could increase complexity in a way that\u2019s negative for usability \u2014 and may raise other concerns, such as around the privacy of user data.\n\nAlthough giving users themselves more say and control over how the consumer tech they own works can certainly be a good idea, at least provided the platform\u2019s presentation of choices isn\u2019t itself manipulative and exploitative.\n\nThere are certainly plenty of pitfalls where IoT and competition are concerned \u2014 but also potential opportunities for startups and smaller players if proactive regulatory action can ensure that dominant platforms don\u2019t get to set all the defaults once again.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Vestager said: \u201cWhen we launched this sector inquiry, we were concerned that there might be a risk of gatekeepers emerging in this sector. We were worried that they could use their power to harm competition, to the detriment of developing businesses and consumers. From the first results published today, it appears that many in the sector share our concerns. And fair competition is needed to make the most of the great potential of the Internet of Things for consumers in their daily lives. This analysis will feed into our future enforcement and regulatory action, so we look forward to receiving further feedback from all interested stakeholders in the coming months.\u201d\n\nThe full sectoral report can be found here.\n\nUpdate: In a speech discussing the findings, Vestager suggested some practices could lead to new competition cases being opened in the future, if confirmed. But she stressed that it\u2019s still early, saying that the Commission still needs to \u201cbetter understand the extent of the concerns\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo far, the results of the sector enquiry confirm the central role of operating systems and voice assistants in the interconnection of different smart devices and services. Respondents flag that this may give providers of operating systems and voice assistants opportunities to engage in behaviors that negatively affect competition,\u201d she also said. \u201cIn the EU, Google Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri are the leading voice assistants. In addition, Google, Amazon and Apple provide the main operating systems for smart home and wearable devices, they offer digital services and they manufacture smart devices.\n\n\u201cIn practice, these companies determine how the different devices and services can communicate and inter-operate with one another. In addition, voice assistants learn a lot about their users. Smart devices and Internet of Things services generate a huge amount of data about what we do in our homes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of the issues identified so far, such as access to data, access to users or barriers to switching, are familiar themes from our enforcement work in digital markets,\u201d she added. \u201cIn fact, a number of the practices reported in the enquiry feature in the Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Markets Act. With today\u2019s preliminary findings and the future work to be done in the coming months, the sector enquiry will certainly contribute to the debate on the scope of the Digital Markets Act.\n\n\u201cThrough competition enforcement and complementary legislative action, we aim at creating a digital economy that works for everyone. To do so, we must make sure that our digital markets, including the consumer Internet of Things, are open and fair for consumers, with room for businesses of all sizes to innovate and grow.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Amazon reached out to send the below statement, responding to the Commission\u2019s report:"}
