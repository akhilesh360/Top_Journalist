The pair raised $58 million from investors such as Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, according to PitchBook. It was valued at $200 million when it raised a $40 million Series A in 2024.\n\nWith this acquisition, Stripe is clearly betting big on crypto.\n\nIn a February 5 post on X, Stripe co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison wrote: \u201cWe expected Bridge (go follow them at @stablecoin) to grow very quickly, and we\u2019re nevertheless shocked at just how rapidly adoption is exploding. In the coming years, everyone programmatically moving money will likely want a stablecoin strategy.\u201d\n\nLast July, Stripe enabled crypto purchases in the EU, and in October, the fintech announced a Pay with Crypto feature that lets merchants accept stablecoins."}
