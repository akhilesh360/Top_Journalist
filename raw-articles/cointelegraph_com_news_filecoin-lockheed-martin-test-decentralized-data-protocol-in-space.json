This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.\n\n\u201cThe architecture is well-suited to space because it reduces delays, compensates for data corruption caused by radiation, and enables cryptographic verification to ensure data has not been tampered with,\u201d she said.\n\nThe foundation is a nonprofit governing the decentralized cloud storage protocol Filecoin (FIL), which uses the IPFS web protocol to store data. Lockheed Martin is one of the world\u2019s largest aerospace companies.\n\nDecentralized storage benefits\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a multi-second delay from the Moon and a multi-minute delay from Mars,\u201d Belcher said.\n\n\u201cWith IPFS, you look for a content ID and retrieve the data from wherever is closest \u2014 your own device, a nearby satellite, or a lunar station.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the IPFS uses a distributed architecture to store multiple copies of data across a global network, reducing reliance on centralized data centers.\n\nThese multiple copies of data improve reliability in environments where hardware is prone to degradation, helping to ensure the integrity of sensitive materials such as satellite images, according to Belcher.\n\nInterest in decentralized archival storage is growing among media companies, and the Foundation is also exploring potential military applications of this technology, Belcher said.\n\n\u201cIt could be really powerful for media in general to have that deep archive and also the ability to have your records everywhere all over the world when needed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe FIL token is a utility token that can be used within the Filecoin ecosystem. It has a total market capitalization of approximately $1.8 billion as of May 16, according to Cointelegraph data.\n\nMagazine: X Hall of Flame: Bitcoin will \u2018start ripping\u2019 as Trump\u2019s polls improve \u2014 Felix Hartmann\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
