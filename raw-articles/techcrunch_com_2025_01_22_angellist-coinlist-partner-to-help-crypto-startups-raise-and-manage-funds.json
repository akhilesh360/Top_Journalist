USDC is the term for a digital dollar, also known as a stablecoin, that can be redeemed 1:1 for U.S. dollars as it is pegged to the dollar.\n\nTokens can be distributed in kind to LPs and are compatible with \u201cmany non-U.S. token issuers and investors.\u201d An integration with CoinList\u2019s software is \u201ccoming soon,\u201d the companies said.\n\n\u201cThe model is significant because investors receive tokens once they are available, instead of receiving cash returns, which is aligned with the crypto ethos of stakeholder participation and self-ownership of assets,\u201d Gulati told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The advantage, the companies said, is that startups don\u2019t have to worry about \u201cmanaging compliance for many stakeholders\u201d at an early stage.\n\n\u201cCrypto startups often seek to bring on many angel investors. With RUVs, dozens of angels who need to sign paperwork, send money, and get proper reporting on an ongoing basis can do so with AngelList Crypto RUVs,\u201d Gulati said.\n\nCrypto\u2019s acceptance in the mainstream investor world where AngelList belongs wavered during crypto winter. That\u2019s when all things Web3 fell out of favor and industry bigwigs like Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao were sentenced to jail.\n\nBut between bitcoin hitting record highs and the Trump administration\u2019s clear interest in it, crypto is poised to come back in vogue in broader tech circles."}
