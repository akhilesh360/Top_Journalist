The startup built its platform on top of the open source Stable Diffusion model, letting users enter text-based prompts to generate their creations.\n\nThe company was founded by Darya Sesitskaya, a former Snap design lead responsible for designing Snapchat\u2019s AR camera, Lens Studio, Lens Cloud and more. She also worked at Wanna (formerly Wannaby), an AR technology company known for its virtual try-ons for sneakers, clothing and watches. Shader\u2019s team is comprised of former Snap AR and Blizzard engineers.\n\nThe company\u2019s flagship product \u2014 which launched in beta on iOS devices in December 2023 \u2014 is a real-time AI camera app where users take a photo of themselves for the app to scan their faces and enter a prompt for the AI to generate a personalized AR effect. Users can then record a video of themselves wearing the mask or filter.\n\nDuring our testing, we noticed results were on the simpler side, however, there were no bugs or glitches. Despite the simplicity, there\u2019s potential for the app to become more than just a fun tool to play around with and show your friends. Shader plans to launch a premium subscription option that provides access to features that are higher in quality, Sesitskaya tells TechCrunch.\n\nThe cross-platform functionality of the app allows users to share creations on Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, giving creators the ability to show off exclusive filters that they\u2019ve conceptualized. Shader will eventually launch an in-app social feed where users can post their templates, allowing other creators to like, comment and try out the effects.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of other AI editing apps, users can also upload photos from their camera roll to customize them using prompts or select from Shader\u2019s premade templates, including a fox mask, a Yoda-inspired mask and an array of filters.\n\nSince launching its beta version, Shader has garnered approximately 3,000 downloads. An Android version is coming soon.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

There\u2019s also a text box for creators to enter prompts. However, it doesn\u2019t look like there are any premade templates available.\n\nShader is also optimizing its iOS app for the newly released Vision Pro, which takes advantage of Apple\u2019s digital persona technology (shown in the image above). In addition, Shader offers an API and plug-in for companies to implement the technology into their own products.\n\nIn terms of funding, Shader raised $580,000 from Betaworks, Greycroft, Differential Ventures, Mozilla Ventures and On Deck. While it\u2019s a modestly sized round, the investment implies there\u2019s still a demand for AR creation tools. The capital is going toward developing new features, such as the ability to use speech-to-text to create prompts and integrating with platforms Twitch, Discord and Zoom, which will allow users to wear AR filters live. It\u2019ll also help grow its marketing team.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to make AR/AI effects accessible to everyone, empowering users to easily create personalized content. Shader is expanding into various social face filters, including background, clothes and hair, prioritizing user-friendly design principles to unlock new possibilities for the 400 million creators on social media. In the near future, we also plan to implement the ability to create voice-to-AR effects and 3D background replacements,\u201d says Sesitskaya.\n\nThe company shared a short demo of the speech-to-text technology on its YouTube channel."}
