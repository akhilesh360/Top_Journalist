Acorai\u2019s novel Heart Monitor device offers the promise of a far more accessible way for qualified medical professionals to get this kind of reading \u2014 directly through the patient\u2019s skin.\n\nThe 2019-founded startup has patented a multipronged sensing system that\u2019s able to pick up different signals through the patient\u2019s chest \u2014 vibrations, sounds, a visual read of blood flow and the heart\u2019s electrical activity \u2014 in order to estimate intracardiac pressure without the patient having to undergo anything more invasive than having a nurse or clinician pop the sensing hardware on their chest for a few minutes.\n\n\u201cThe original idea was to be a remote monitoring tool for patients,\u201d CEO Filip Peters tells TechCrunch. \u201cFor a patient to take home the tool and do this themselves, in their home, enabling preventive care . . . But then we realized that the in-hospital workflow seems to be completely overlooked and cardiologists and nurses and hospitals were sort of screaming out for a tool that they could use to help manage patients that are already in the hospital. And realized that that was perhaps a a superior value proposition \u2014 at least to start off with. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve focused the company on.\u201d\n\nThe initial target for the heart monitoring product is suspected or confirmed heart failure patients \u2014 of which he says there are about 60 million worldwide.\n\n\u201cBy our estimates, only about 10% of [heart failure] patients actually get the invasive procedure,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo I think one of the benefits that we have is that you can follow your patient temporarily \u2014 you can measure two or three times per day and then see the trend of these measurements over time. Which with a one-off catheterization you can\u2019t by definition.\u201d\n\nInside the handheld unit \u2014 which is roughly the size (and shape) of a smartphone, in a visual nod at the growing consumerization of medical kits \u2014 are seismic sensors that detect tiny vibrations on the surface of the patient\u2019s chest; acoustic sensors (\u201ceffectively our own optimized stethoscopes,\u201d per Peters) that he says listen for \u201cvery specific frequency ranges\u201d; visual sensors that aim to detect blood flow just under the skin; and ECG sensors to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cWe borrowed heavily from non-medical industries \u2014 in terms of choosing the sensor stack, the technology stack,\u201d he explains. \u201cPrimarily the oil and gas industry \u2014 and kind of engine diagnostics. What we found there is that there\u2019s been a lot of research into non-invasive sensing of fluid and pressure dynamics, using seismic sensors and acoustic sensors. So non-ultrasonic sensors and detecting, effectively, very small vibrations that correlate with pressure and flow.\u201d\n\nPeters says the system feeds the raw sensor data into proprietary machine learning algorithms Acorai has developed, which are trained to identify patterns and combine signals \u201coptimally\u201d to estimate patients\u2019 intracardiac pressures directly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no traditional signal processing that creates a waveform for someone to look at. But we\u2019ve found that there\u2019s a lot of signal value in raw [sensor] data,\u201d he suggests. \u201cSo what we present on the screen is a direct estimate of the pressure \u2014 and not, you know, a red/yellow/green risk index or something like that. But a very real and interpretable number that [clinicians] can then bake into the overall assessment of those patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are able to estimate these pressures directly, as opposed to an AI index of risk or something like that \u2014 and I think that\u2019s a very important competitive differentiator for us,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is what the cardiologists and nurses want to see in terms of the output. Something that doesn\u2019t tell them what to do but that they can bake into the overall assessment of their patients. That\u2019s been a recurring recurring theme for a lot of the market interviews that we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nOn accuracy, he says the data the Heart Monitor presents is \u201cclinically meaningful information\u201d \u2014 summarizing it as \u201csimilar to the implantable sensors on the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat that means in numbers is we have correlation of above .8 versus that right heart cath[eterization] gold standard,\u201d he also tells us, adding: \u201cGiven that we are non-invasive, we have a bit more leeway to be, perhaps, less accurate \u2014 even though we\u2019re currently meeting those standards.\n\n\u201cEqually, when we\u2019re looking at specific cut-off points \u2014 so identifying elevated pressures, for example \u2014 we are in the high 80s in terms of percentage accuracy levels. So, overall, really good. That was our pilot study in Sweden \u2014 which was over 300 patients and over 1,000 measurements. And now we\u2019re doing that same study with a second generation of the device in a large global study with 1,500 patients, 14 hospitals in six countries.\u201d\n\nAsked about risks of bias in AI-powered analysis of sensor data, such as if training datasets do not properly reflect the diversity of the patient population, he says they\u2019ve used a mix of their own proprietary datasets (collected during clinical studies) and other data they were able to access, via healthcare provider partners including in Sweden, London, the U.S. and Canada, to try to ensure the development of robust machine learning algorithms.\n\nHe also says the decision to include a range of sensors in the hardware was aimed at shrinking bias and accuracy risks, so the device can, for example, adapt outputs to the patient. \u201cPart of why we have such a diverse range of sense technologies is for our machine learning models to be able to dynamically adapt to the type of patient that we are looking at,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSo if it is a patient with, perhaps, a darker skin pigment, then the visual sensors may be less important in making a final estimate of that patient, for example. So we\u2019ve built in internal controls on bias \u2014 but then also, you know, robustness in terms of how the device records, so adjusting for patient movement, adjusting for loud environments when the patient is recording and things like that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting Acorai is positioning the handheld product as a clinician-support tool, rather than a diagnostic medical device. So the tool is intended to be always in the hands of a trained medical professional who would, ultimately, be responsible for taking any patient care decisions.\n\nDespite prototyping and building the product in Europe, Acorai\u2019s go-to-market strategy is initially focused on the U.S., where \u2014 pending regulatory clearance \u2014 it\u2019s hoping to get the handheld to market and into hospitals in the second half of 2025.\n\nBack in August, it was granted a \u201cBreakthrough Device Designation\u201d by the U.S.\u2019 medical device regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under a new program it\u2019s running. Specifically, the designation was for \u201cthe non-invasive estimation of diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (dPAP), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP); and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) in patients with Stage C Heart Failure who have been referred for hemodynamic monitoring.\u201d\n\nFor that it provided preliminary data of 281 patients from a 400-patient Swedish pilot study, which its PR claims \u201cdemonstrated a strong correlation to the invasive gold-standard measurements of pulmonary pressure.\u201d\n\nThe next step will entail Acorai undertaking a larger study so it can submit more data to the FDA to support an application for clearance for clinical use of its tool in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s one of a handful of startups participating in the FDA\u2019s \u201cBreakthrough Device Program,\u201d which is aimed at supporting the development of novel devices to get to market. Peters says this program\u2019s \u201ctailored support\u201d has been extremely helpful \u2014 saying it\u2019s one of the reasons why the team is opting to commercialize their product in the U.S. first, rather than in Europe, where healthcare regulation (and markets) are more fragmented.\n\nHe also points to recent changes to EU medical device rules that he says have slowed down clearances for novel medical devices as the notified bodies that have to do conformity assessments get up to speed with the 2021 Medical Devices Regulation.\n\n\u201cWhereas the FDA seems to be going the other direction \u2014 streamlining the process for, particularly, \u2018breakthrough technologies\u2019 . . . and making it easier for companies like ours to get to the market,\u201d he suggests.\n\nThe startup, which eagle-eyed attendees of TechCrunch Disrupt 2022 might recall since it was exhibiting as one of the Startup Battlefield 200, has just closed a $4.5 million+ seed raise. The oversubscribed seed round was led by Solardis Health Ventures, with participation from KHP Ventures, Carma Fund and a number of other new U.S. investors. Acorai adds that \u201csignificant\u201d follow-on investment came from existing investors from across Sweden and the EU.\n\n\u201cBoth Mayo Clinic and Cedars-Sinai invested,\u201d notes Peters. \u201cWe have Bayer on the heart failure pharma side invested. And then, as usual, a lot of angel investors \u2014 but then also some smaller VCs out of London.\u201d\n\nHe says the seed funding will \u201cmainly\u201d be used for clinical studies as it works toward FDA approval for clinical use (rather than the \u201cinvestigational\u201d use the FDA\u2019s breakthrough device designation permits). Toward the end of this year, the team will also be looking to raise a Series A, per Peters, \u201cfor getting us through the regulatory pathways around the world but also for that initial go-to-market commercialization primarily in the U.S.\u201d"}
