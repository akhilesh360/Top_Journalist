This isn\u2019t a problem for large companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, which can afford to build their own, but almost everyone else is stuck with long wait times and high costs.\n\nAgile Space Industries is looking to change that. Founder Daudi Barnes started the company in 2019 to augment the work of his previous company, Advanced Mobile Propulsion Test (AMPT). AMPT provided hypergolic engine testing, but as Agile, the company has expanded into propulsion systems, thrusters, rocket engines, and ground support equipment.\n\nThe Colorado-based startup already operates one test stand, called Sunshine, which AMPT stood up in 2010. Last week, it inaugurated a second stand, called Animas \u2014 the only commercial facility capable of vacuum testing hypergolic engines more than 300 pounds and up to 6,000 pounds of thrust, the company says.\n\n\u201cThe market is just really, really expanding really fast right now,\u201d Animas project manager Graham Dudley explained. \u201cThe barrier to entry for rocket engines has gotten lower, so there\u2019s a lot of people in that game. For testing though? It\u2019s really, really hard to do.\u201d\n\nAnimas is designed for modularity, so it can be used for test campaigns ranging from early prototype testing to qualification and acceptance testing. The stand is built on skids, in pieces that can be moved or replaced out, so Agile can handle whatever kind of test it (or a customer) needs.\n\nEngine testing provides the company an additional revenue stream, offering services to other space ventures while also enabling quicker in-house engine development.\n\n\u201cBeing able to have easy access to testing earlier in your programs is really helpful,\u201d Agile\u2019s lead test engineer Mesa Hollinbeck said. \u201cWe\u2019ve run into several programs, back when we were AMPT, that got really far into their design before they actually hot fired [the engine], and it didn\u2019t work. So they\u2019ve had four plus years of design and development that they have to reboot on, and that\u2019s really, really expensive and hard for your schedule prediction. So having access to testing early is definitely a problem for a lot of the industry.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But this is resource-intensive, Hollinbeck said: \u201cA lot of smaller NewSpace companies, it\u2019s just really expensive to put that infrastructure in and they don\u2019t want to make that investment. They want to spend their money in other places. It\u2019s somewhat easy to make a cool hot fire video of an engine in the desert with your really cheap test stand, but to get actual data that allows you to fly your equipment \u2014 it\u2019s a higher level of sophistication.\u201d\n\nOwning the test bed means that Agile engineers have access to ample data on their systems. It\u2019s a competitive edge in the space propulsion market, which has become increasingly crowded as the cost to launch spacecraft to orbit has dropped. Many engines fire for the first time on orbit, but that could change as more high-profile, costly missions head to the moon and deep space.\n\nDudley said that some of the external requests for testing that Agile has received indicated \u201ca concern from multiple organizations that there is not enough testing of the engines that are going into some of the missions that they\u2019re supporting, and that it\u2019s putting those missions at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are hearing that directly, that the reason they want to come to us is because they\u2019re concerned that if they can\u2019t find testing, it\u2019ll increase the risk profile for their missions, and it\u2019s unacceptable for them going forward.\u201d"}
