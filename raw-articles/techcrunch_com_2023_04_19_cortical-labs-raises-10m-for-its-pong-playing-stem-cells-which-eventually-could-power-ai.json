There is also the process of using biology: the idea of using stem cells to create biocomputers that could potentially be smarter and more energy efficient than what we are used to today.\n\nAustralian startup Cortical Labs popped up on the radar after Amazon CTO Werner Vogels flew down to Australia to visit their lab recently, and he even wrote about it, calling it \u201cintriguing.\u201d\n\nCortical combines synthetic biology and human neurons to develop what it claims is a class of AI, known as \u201cOrganoid Intelligence\u201d (OI).\n\nIt\u2019s now raised a $10 million funding round led by Horizons Ventures, with participation from LifeX (Life Extension) Ventures (the launch of which which we covered last year), Blackbird Ventures, Radar Ventures and In-Q-Tel (the venture arm of the CIA).\n\nThe company says it is already in the process of fulfilling orders for its technology.\n\nHow it works is that it uses clusters of lab-cultivated neurons from human stem cells to form what it calls a \u201cDishBrain,\u201d which is then hooked-up to hard silicon to create what it describes as a Biological Intelligence Operating System (biOS).\n\nSome observers say this is the future of AI because human neurons could be better than any digital AI model for generalized intelligence, given that they are self-programming and require far less energy consumption.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Organoid Intelligence has the potential to learn faster and use far less energy than any other AI system in existence. GPT is so smart because it ingested all of the Internet, however you or I don\u2019t have to for us to have pretty good conversational skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took at least 10 years since Geoff Hinton and Alex Krizhevsky put a GPU to do Deep Learning that we\u2019ve gotten to where we are today. We\u2019re still in the early days of this technology,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the immediate term, he says an immediate application is to effectively drip a new drug onto the cells to test it \u2014 if the cells can no longer play Pong, you know the drug doesn\u2019t work: \u201cNot only is the efficacy able to be better determined but also the cognitive side-effects (brain fog) can be elucidated as we now have a potential assay for cognition in the form of neurons playing the Pong game.\u201d\n\nHe says the technology could also be used to study dementia and even \u201cbrute force\u201d test the compounds that we have discovered using Quantum Computing and Generative AI.\u201d\n\nAnd potentially further into the future \u201cif the number and complexity of these neurons are scaled, the end result would be familiar to us as fully embodied organisms such as a cat, dog, or human.\u201d\n\nHold on to your hats, people."}
