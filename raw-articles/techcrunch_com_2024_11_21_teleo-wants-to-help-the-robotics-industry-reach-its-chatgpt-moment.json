Today, Teleo\u2019s retrofitted machinery allows its customers to operate their existing fleets semi-autonomously. In the future, the startup sees the data it collects as a key enabler for the robotics industry to reach its \u201cChatGPT moment.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t an aspiration to reach the same level of hype surrounding ChatGPT. Instead, Teleo CEO Vinay Shet sees an opportunity for robotics companies \u2014 and namely the one he runs \u2014 to gather vast datasets similar to amounts used to build ChatGPT in order to make big, game-changing leaps in robotics.\n\nAnd investors seem keen to help the startup reach that milestone. TechCrunch has learned that Teleo recently raised $16.2 million in funding through two extensions to its 2022 Series A round. The $9.2 million extension closed in April and another $7 million one closed this week, according to recent filings and information from the company.\n\n\u201cThe foundation models that led to the creation of ChatGPT relied significantly on, effectively, trillions of tokens worth of data that was freely available on the internet, on language, on videos, on images, and so forth. That data does not exist in robotics,\u201d Shet told TechCrunch. \u201cThe best dataset that we know of in the robotics world is about 2.4 million tokens, whereas in the language world, they train it on trillions of tokens.\u201d\n\nTeleo aims to bridge that gap by logging data from its own daily operations, which Shet says will end up \u201cbecoming the basis upon which you can train true robotic foundation models\u201d that can lead to generalized intelligence.\n\nTo build that repertoire of data, Teleo needs to deploy rapidly, at scale, and across several industries. And the company\u2019s strategy for doing that is wrapped up in its semi-autonomous approach. Teleo can retrofit any piece of equipment with the necessary self-driving software and sensors \u2014 like cameras, lidar, and radar \u2014 to drive themselves autonomously in limited conditions. Remote human operators then step in to perform more complicated tasks, like unloading a dump truck, and can typically handle multiple vehicles at a time.\n\n\u201cThat combination is what lets us solve the whole use case for the customer while delivering [return on investment] to the customer and making money through a stand-alone product,\u201d Shet said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Teleo is also targeting industries like airports, waste and recycling, logistics, and snow removal.\n\nThe hope is that the data it collects \u2014 including inputs from human operators, video footage, and sensor feedback \u2014 will allow Teleo to fine-tune or specialize foundational robotics models. This could eventually enable the replacement or augmentation of the human in the loop with a cloud-based AI agent capable of learning to control different machines, as a human would.\n\nThis long-term thinking is no doubt what attracted investors to the company. Teleo\u2019s recent extensions were led by UP.Partners with participation from new investors Trousdale Ventures and Triatomic Capital, as well as returning investors F-Prime Capital and Trucks VC, among others.\n\nTeleo says the funds will be used to scale customer deployments, continue expanding to new industries, and enhance the startup\u2019s AI capabilities, including an integration of large language models to unlock operator efficiency.\n\n\u201cOver the next several years, you will see vertically integrated companies like ourselves actually deploy in the real world in a manner that makes sense economically speaking and grows economically based off that,\u201d Shet said. \u201cBut along the way, they\u2019ll collect enough data in the right format so that it unlocks that \u2018aha\u2019 moment a few years down the road.\u201d"}
