It\u2019s all about creating a digital-paper trail for auditability.\n\nCompliance\n\nFinancial compliance spending reportedly topped $274 billion in 2022, up from $214 billion two years previous, and can account for more than 5% of institutions\u2019 annual budgets. There are a growing array of technologies designed to help banks and similar entities address the regulatory demands of governments across the globe, and investors are taking note. London-based SteelEye recently raised $21 million for a cloud-based compliance platform that promises to streamline regulatory reporting and reduce the risk of non-compliance. And earlier this year, another London-based company called GSS secured $45 million to help banks screen for any sanctions that may have been imposed by governments.\n\nDroit, which raised a $16 million Series A round some six years ago, says that it plans to use its fresh cash injection to support its expansion into wealth management, extending its existing capital market regulatory automation to further use cases.\n\nThe company\u2019s Series B round was led by Pivot Investment Partners and its customer UBS, with participation from existing investor \u2014 and customer \u2014 Goldman Sachs."}
