Preteens can either request which world they\u2019d like to access, or parents can go through the list and select specific ones to grant permission.\n\nMeta has also implemented additional safety measures that aim to ensure kids are protected. For instance, there is a new rating system \u2014 10+, 13+ or 18+ \u2014 that signals which VR world is appropriate for younger users. This allows parents to approve all 10+ rated worlds at once, making 18+ worlds no longer visible to preteens. Also, there are no follower suggestions, and the preteens\u2019 status and visibility settings are set to show as \u201coffline\u201d to others by default \u2014 unless parents manually enable them.\n\nAdditionally, the \u201cPersonal Boundary\u201d setting is permanently on, which gives avatars a bubble with a radius of two virtual feet, preventing people from coming too close to them.\n\nThe announcement follows Meta adding the ability for parents to individually approve contacts that their child can chat with and invite to join them in VR experiences. Another recent update prompts anyone with a Meta Quest 2 or 3 headset to re-enter their birthday before using the device.\n\nParent-managed accounts for preteens have been available since June 2023.\n\nDespite these new safety measures, some parents and guardians will likely still have doubts that Meta will protect their children, given the numerous accusations that the company fails to keep the age group safe on its platforms.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Another lawsuit filed by 42 U.S. state attorneys accuses Meta of intentionally designing its products to attract children, which negatively impacts their mental well-being."}
