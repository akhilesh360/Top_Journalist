The tool is paired with a product description and pricing information, along with a simplified checkout flow designed to streamline the purchasing process.\n\nAR Beauty ads will show up in the mobile-specific channels Google Shopping ads typically do, including the Shopping tab on Google.com, Search and Google Images.\n\n\u201cAR Beauty ads help our beauty brand partners showcase their products in a more interactive way to capture demand,\u201d reads a press release attributed to Lilian Rincon, senior director of consumer shopping at Google, shared with TechCrunch yesterday. \u201cWhen a new tool is helpful for shoppers, it can be helpful for the entire industry.\u201d\n\nThe rollout of AR Beauty ads \u2014 which comes as Google debuts virtual try-on tools for hair color and foundation in Search, including a tool that lets users virtually try foundation on themselves \u2014 reflects the tech and ad industry\u2019s growing belief in AR as a powerful force for marketing.\n\nIn May, Meta announced that it would roll out AR ads to Instagram Reels and Facebook Stories later this year. (Meta first tested AR ads in the Facebook News Feed in July 2018.) Pok\u00e9mon GO developer Niantic piloted AR ad experiences during the Cannes Lions festival in early spring. And Snapchat has long offered AR ads through its Lens technology and platform.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Powered by FameBit, Google\u2019s in-house branded content platform, viewers could virtually try on makeup while following along with YouTube creators to get tips and product reviews.\n\nThe mad rush isn\u2019t fueled by hype alone \u2014 or so brands say.\n\nAccording to Shopify data, AR ads often perform better than display ads, with the average 3D AR ad generating 94% higher conversion rates than its static, 2D counterpart. Meanwhile, Snap and Deloitte find that brands offering AR experiences are 41% more likely to be considered by customers, and that nearly three in four shoppers are were willing to pay more for a product that they can explore with AR.\n\nGoogle, for its part, said that its 2019 YouTube experiment with VR ads resulted in just under a third of viewers spending over 80 seconds trying on lipstick on average. And the company claims that, after interacting with the virtual try-on tools on Google Search, shoppers are \u201cmeasurably\u201d more likely to spend time on a brand\u2019s site, research a product or make a purchase.\n\nAll those metrics are perhaps why, by 2025, global AR ad revenue is projected to grow to $6.68 billion \u2014 a steep increase from 2020, when it totaled $1.36 billion."}
