CTO Kral was studying plant development biology, while CEO Pelton is a crop scientist. He told TechCrunch that his grandfather was a farmer, and he grew up hearing about crops failing due to the U.K.\u2019s weather and other factors.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to be where we are with genetics,\u201d Pelton said. \u201cYou can do the whole plant genome for a few hundred dollars and synthesize the genome as well. Nic and I were PhD students and decided to give it a go, taking technology and applying it to some problems we see.\u201d\n\nCurrent breeding methods to improve crops usually take decades to develop, and genetically modified organism technologies are limited, he said.\n\nPhytoform\u2019s approach to developing new climate-resilient crops involves machine learning and genome editing technologies to determine the number of possible DNA sequence combinations in plants and identify new traits, while also reducing agriculture\u2019s climate footprint. Then those traits are implemented directly into crop varieties using footprint-free CRISPR genome editing.\n\nThe success of CRISPR technology in agriculture has been well documented over the years as a way to manipulate plant genomes to make them more pest and climate resistant and grow more consistent products.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

We were immediately drawn to Phytoform\u2019s founders Will and Nick\u2019s approach of using deep machine learning on plant genetics combined with genome editing to offer a portfolio of optimized produce to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe new funding will enable Phytoform to expand its team and boost its work introducing traits in tomatoes and potatoes so that there is greater yield and fewer crop losses along the food supply chain.\n\nThe co-founders say 2022 \u201cis going to be a great year\u201d for the company as it prepares to bring its tomato and potato program to market. They are also working on three other programs and have expanded their geographies from just the U.S. to Australia and the U.K.\n\nIn addition, they have focused efforts on partnerships with individuals and companies at the beginning of the supply chain \u2014 seed breeders and producers \u2014 and future plans to expand that to food producers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s initial business model will be royalty revenue from the sale of the seeds, but expects that to change as its customer base evolves all the way to the consumer, Pelton said.\n\nPhytoform started the year with six employees and has now doubled its headcount, Kral said. In addition, it has achieved good technological growth with proof of concept for its AI process both in software and web lab capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe still have quite a big process on the way to get the tomato program in the late stages of development, but we will continue to do more trials,\u201d he added. \u201cCurrent technology is taking a decade to generate new varieties, but we are proving we can cut that down.\u201d"}
