After leaving the tech giant, Epstein \u2014 who observed while at Google that this type of infrastructure tended to be expensive and complicated \u2014 set out to build what he describes as an affordable, streamlined \u201cgrowth intelligence\u201d platform to enable brands to measure the impact of their media spend.\n\n\u201cThe digital marketing industry is under more scrutiny than ever,\u201d Epstein told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cNew privacy regulations are rolling out and platforms are more concerned about user privacy and data sharing. This creates an opportunity for new companies to create value using novel econometric and machine learning techniques.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s platform, Haus, is designed to be used by any brand spending on marketing across one or more channels (e.g. social media, SMS, display advertising and so on). With Haus, users can configure on-demand regional experiments to test different marketing strategies and conduct demand forecasts, accounting for the effects of seasonality and a business\u2019 general health.\n\n\u201cEnterprise organizations have extreme difficulty differentiating signal from noise in their marketing efforts,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cLarge organizations have a lot of organic momentum, and it can be very difficult to isolate the impact of marketing \u2026 Using Haus, marketers, board members, executive teams and finance are able to evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing relying only on their own internal data.\u201d\n\nIndeed, companies often struggle to measure a marketing campaign\u2019s return on investment (ROI). The reasons are myriad, but as one survey reveals, many marketing leaders aren\u2019t confident in their employer\u2019s own data. Complicating matters is a lack of alignment on the measurement of marketing ROI; the same survey found that marketing, sales and finance teams at 40% of companies can\u2019t agree on a definition of \u201csuccessful ROI.\u201d\n\nYet, thanks to macroeconomic headwinds, marketers are under increasing pressure to show that they\u2019re making gains. Responding to a Marketing Week poll, 77% of CMOs said that they feel the need to prove their campaigns are providing \u201cenhanced short-term ROI,\u201d lest their CEOs redirect their budgets.\n\n\u201cThe broader slowdown in tech, and the economy writ large, has pushed organizations to think about profitability and efficiency,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cIn this market, every dollar is being scrutinized, and Haus\u2019 platform enables companies to run experiments that identify what works and what drives profitability.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That momentum, in turn, has attracted investors. Haus today announced that it raised $17 million in a funding round led by Insight Partners, bringing its total raised to $24 million.\n\nEpstein says the proceeds will be put primarily toward growing Haus\u2019 headcount from 24 to roughly 35 by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThis new money will allow Haus to continue to hire world-class economists, data scientists and engineers to build out the suite of analytics tools on the Haus roadmap,\u201d he added. \u201cHaus will be looking to scale its go to market efforts, generating broader awareness for these tools.\u201d"}
