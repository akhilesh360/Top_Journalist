Today, nearly a terawatt of zero-carbon generating capacity is waiting to be hooked up to the grid. That\u2019s enough to decarbonize 80% of U.S. electricity by the end of the decade, according to the Lawrence Berkeley Lab.\n\nTo get there, though, the grid needs some upgrades, which also couldn\u2019t come at a better time. The U.S. electrical grid is aging (70% of transmission lines are over 25 years old) and outmoded \u2014 it was originally designed with massive fossil fuel power plants in mind not distributed renewable sources.\n\nBut new transmission lines \u2014 the large, high-tension wires that form the backbone of the grid \u2014 are expensive. Depending on the voltage and where they\u2019re being built, they start at over $1 million per mile and go up from there.\n\nThat\u2019s why for the last five years, LineVision has been working on a way to unlock additional capacity on existing transmission lines. The startup recently closed a $33 million Series C led by Climate Innovation Capital and S2G Ventures. With the new funding, the company has been growing its team and moved into new offices down the street from Greentown Labs in Somerville, Massachusetts, where it incubated. It\u2019s also been expanding partnerships with major utilities.\n\nNow, LineVision tells TechCrunch that it\u2019s teaming up with GE\u2019s Grid Solutions division, integrating its dynamic line rating technology with complementary offerings from GE to give utilities a more comprehensive way to monitor their transmission lines and boost the amount of electricity they can safely carry.\n\nThe partnership was driven in part by utilities, which are necessarily cautious about integrating new technologies \u2014 after all, crashing the grid comes with pretty significant consequences.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But it\u2019s really hard for us as a utility to be put in the position of having to kind of piece them all together,\u2019\u201d LineVision co-founder and CEO Hudson Gilmer told TechCrunch. \u201cNow we can say, \u2018We\u2019ve already done that for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nLineVision\u2019s and GE\u2019s teams are already integrating the technologies behind the scenes, said Jonathan Marmillo, LineVision\u2019s co-founder and VP of product. \u201cWe\u2019re going to our clients jointly, together and telling them we\u2019ve developed this integrated solution.\u201d\n\nTransmission lines are all rated to carry certain amounts of electricity. It\u2019s determined by a number of variables, including the size of the wire and what it\u2019s made of, how far it is off the ground and weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed and the intensity of the sunlight. If a line exceeds its rating, it may sag too far, endangering people below and increasing the risk of fire if it touches a tree or shrub.\n\nSome line ratings are based on worst-case scenarios, like a hot, sunny day with low winds and lots of current flowing through the line. Others take seasonality into account, but they\u2019re still rough estimates.\n\nMost transmission lines operate in conditions that are often far better than the ratings assume. But without real-time data, grid operators have to err on the side of caution and send less power through the line. That means lines can become congested and operators end up leaving capacity on the table.\n\nIf high demand overloads a line, it can act just like congestion on a highway. Cheaper sources of power aren\u2019t able to get through, so grid operators have to call on the power that is available, which is often more expensive.\n\nBy itself, LineVision\u2019s dynamic line rating technology can allow a transmission line to carry 15% to 40% more power, Gilmer said, though in one ideal scenario the boost was over 50%. They install sensors, including a lidar unit that watches for line sag and other parameters, to determine whether the line is handling more power than it\u2019s rated for.\n\nLineVision\u2019s pitch to utilities is that its system costs about 5% of what it would cost to build a new line, Gilmer said, and the payback period is often on the order of months, not years, in part because utilities can more readily access cheaper forms of power without having to build new lines.\n\nGilmer pointed to a trade organization study that shows that the amount of renewables that the grid could support in Kansas and Oklahoma, for example, could more than double if grid-enhancing technologies are installed. \u201cThe payback period would be less than six months,\u201d he added.\n\nThe grid will still need new transmission lines, but grid-enhancing technologies could help bridge the gap. \u201cThere is such a compelling urgency to get the most out of the existing wires,\u201d Gilmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s the low-hanging fruit.\u201d"}
