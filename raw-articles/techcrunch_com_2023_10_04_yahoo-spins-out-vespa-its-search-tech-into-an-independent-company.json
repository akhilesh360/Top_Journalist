Yahoo will also own a stake in Vespa and hold a seat on the spun-out firm\u2019s board of directors.\n\nYahoo created Vespa back in 2005 after acquiring paid search service provider Overture, and, through it, a Norwegian search engine called AlltheWeb.com. Working with the e-commerce division within Yahoo, the AllTheWeb team of roughly 30 people retooled their search tech into a more general-purpose tool that Yahoo developers could use internally to compute over large-scale datasets in real time.\n\nOver the next decade or so, Yahoo expanded Vespa along several directions, enabling the tool to handle input beyond text strings, personalize content based on users\u2019 click-through histories and take direction from machine learning algorithms. Then, in 2017, Yahoo open sourced Vespa, hoping to rally developer support behind the software \u2014 and foster something of an ecosystem both internally and externally.\n\nIt was arguably Yahoo\u2019s biggest open source software release since Hadoop in 2006, involving a substantial rewrite of the Vespa codebase by the Vespa group, still based in Norway. And it evidently paid off. Today, Vespa drives searches and related-article recommendations on Yahoo-owned sites and performs ad targeting on Yahoo-branded web properties such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News and Yahoo\u2019s advertising network.\n\nYahoo claims that it\u2019s using around 150 apps created with Vespa and that these apps collectively serve a user base of a billion people \u2014 processing 800,000 queries per second.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And Vespa\u2019s open source package has been downloaded over 10 million times.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a number of open source alternatives to Vespa available, including Solr and Elasticsearch, Yahoo makes the case that Vespa goes \u201cseveral steps further\u201d than what\u2019s on the market.\n\n\u201cThe biggest differentiator stems from our vision of providing for the complete needs of any application that combines data and AI at scale online,\u201d Bratseth told me via email. \u201cWe have a very experienced team who are all working on improving Vespa to this vision, and a culture of continuously shipping improvements, and \u2014 from what I can see \u2014 we\u2019re still moving much faster than any others.\u201d\n\nSo why spin Vespa out into its own company? Capacity, Bratseth says.\n\n\u201cA growing number of companies are asking to deploy their applications to our cloud service, and we\u2019ll have more capacity to build out this functionality as a stand-alone,\u201d he told me.\n\nI wonder whether Yahoo\u2019s plan to return to the public markets had something to do with the move, too. But neither Bratseth nor Lara Davis, Yahoo\u2019s chief strategy officer, would confirm or deny this. (I tried to reach Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone for comment through a Yahoo spokesperson, but was told he was traveling.)\n\n\u201cSince 2017, Vespa has been helping customers perform a variety of AI-powered tasks: searching millions of documents within a global organization, serving better data-driven online ads or allowing AI-based language apps the ability to scale,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe know Vespa is the market-leading technology for doing that at scale, so the opportunity for Yahoo to continue as both an investor and customer, continuing to root for their success, is a phenomenal outcome for everyone. As part of the deal, we are migrating key proprietary and battle-tested platform technology to Vespa and will continue to support many of their systems as they transition to an independent company.\u201d\n\nLanzone did provide a prepared statement more or less echoing what Davis said:\n\n\u201cVespa has been a critical component to Yahoo\u2019s AI and machine learning capabilities across all of our properties for many years,\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cWhile remaining Vespa\u2019s biggest customer and a key investor, we\u2019ll continue to leverage all that Vespa has to offer while simultaneously creating a new business opportunity that allows other companies to harness its technology as an independent entity.\u201d"}
