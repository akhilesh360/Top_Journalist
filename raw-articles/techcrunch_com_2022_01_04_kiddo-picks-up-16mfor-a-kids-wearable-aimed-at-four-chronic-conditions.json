Through a combination of wearables, parental coaching and telehealth, the company has its sights firmly set on managing care for kids with chronic health conditions.\n\nKiddo has been working on developing a wearable and software combo for children\u2019s health for several years. The company was founded in 2016 by Jaganath \u201cCJ\u201d Swamy, who was initially interested in developing a health and wellness device that would be fun for kids to use and offer parents the ability to monitor health. However, the company has now revamped to focus fully on managing chronic health conditions.\n\nThat focus, Swamy tells TechCrunch, is partially inspired by his own experience. He was in the midst of transitioning away from working as an early-stage investor when one of his sons began to have asthma-like breathing problems.\n\n\u201cWe were struggling to manage and monitor what was happening with him on a daily basis, and with passing that information back to his physician, so that she could modify the treatment protocol appropriately,\u201d Swamy tells TechCrunch. \u201cAs we were kind of going through this struggle, it started making me think about how we could try and make this a better experience for parents, who essentially have to kind of manage kids with a chronic condition.\u201d\n\nThe result was Kiddo, a care coordination platform aimed at kids aged two to 15. The child receives a proprietary wristband (it looks something like a FitBit), the parents download an app that collects data from that wearable and relays that information to the child\u2019s doctor. The platform is specifically designed to monitor children with asthma, heart disease, autism and diabetes.\n\nThe round was led by Clearlake-Capital backed Vive Collective and brings Kiddo\u2019s total funding to $25 million. Other investors include Wavemaker 360, Wavemaker Asia Pacific, Mojo Partners, along with Techstars and affiliated funds.\n\nBroadly, Kiddo falls into the \u201cremote patient monitoring\u201d category. It\u2019s designed to help patients obtain the same basic care they might receive in a primary care office from home.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Meanwhile, the app integrates that data with other metrics like local air quality conditions (a key metric for asthma patients), weather, and humidity. Over time, Kiddo develops a profile for each child based on these characteristics. Should those metrics significantly deviate from the norm, a parent would receive a notification, as well as a list of tips that might help them control the situation at home.\n\nFor example, if a child showing signs of an imminent asthma attack, a parent might receive an alert suggesting that breathing rates and heart rates were out of regular ranges. Then, the app might give some general suggestions as to how to manage the situation. \u201cWe might say, \u2018hey, let the child rest for an hour, give them a glass of cold water or put them in an air conditioned environment or, based on the advice of a physician take albuterol,\u201d says Swamy.\n\nIf symptoms persist, the app allows parents to schedule a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nThe idea of remote patient monitoring itself isn\u2019t new, but there have been more studies published on the idea in recent years. One 2020 systematic review in the journal \u201cTelemedicine and e-Health,\u201d for example, found that 43% of 272 reviewed articles were published between 2015 and 2018. In about 77% of those studies, remote patient monitoring had a positive impact on patient care.\n\nKiddo is investing in clinical validation of its services, though Swamy notes that no data has yet been published publicly (\u201cThe data is confidential and only to be shared with customers,\u201d he said via followup email). But he did say that research from academic and partners and private parties has \u201cvalidated many aspects of the Kiddo platform.\u201d That process will include a new study under development at Thompson Autism Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County, he said.\n\nThe company\u2019s own data, says Swamy, suggests the platform improves treatment adherence more than 50% and led to a \u201c2x reduction\u201d in unnecessary ER visits. But again, this data is unpublished.\n\nKiddo currently hasn\u2019t received FDA marketing clearance but is aiming for Class I certification (this is a class reserved for low-risk devices).\n\nSo far, the company also has partnered with seven health systems, benefits providers and foundations, including UHC Optum, PC Health and \u201cseveral children\u2019s hospitals\u201d per a press release (other partners were not disclosed).\n\nCritically, Swamy says the company sees itself solely as a B2B provider. It has no plans to go direct to consumer \u2014 but rather will focus on partnering with hospitals and health systems.\n\nKiddo\u2019s most recent round of funding comes after a big year for the company when it comes to users. So far, the company is working with 70,000 children, with plans to expand to about 200,000 in the next few years. That traction, he notes, is one of the drivers of investor interest, but it\u2019s not the only trend working in Kiddo\u2019s favor.\n\nThere is also regulatory movement that could favor remote patient monitoring. Historically, there have been limited numbers of CPT codes (reimbursement codes) for remote monitoring technology. Beginning in 2018, some codes have been repurposed and others added to make it easier for providers to charge for remote patient monitoring.\n\nThat trend is continuing. In 2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has expanded the amount of reimbursement codes that apply to remote patient monitoring \u2014 allowing payers to bill for even more types of remote patient monitoring these services.\n\nThe regulatory landscape for remote patient monitoring is still very much in flux \u2014 though these regulations are moving in a direction that probably helps companies like Kiddo. According to Swamy, Kiddo\u2019s technology is reimbursable thanks to these CPT codes. \u201cSo there\u2019s a financial kind of outcome for the health systems that we work with,\u201d he adds.\n\nWith this current round, Swamy hopes to increase the size of Kiddo\u2019s sales and product development teams. He also has ambitions to expand the amount of chronic conditions Kiddo can treat. Right now, the company has an eye on pediatric oncology and orthopedics services, and hopes to move in that direction in the next two years."}
