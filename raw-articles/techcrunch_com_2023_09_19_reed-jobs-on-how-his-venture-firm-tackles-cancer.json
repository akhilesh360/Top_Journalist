Yosemite, Jobs\u2019 fund for cancer-fighting biotech, launched in August with $200 million in funding from investors like MIT, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and John Doerr. Jobs first became interested in oncology as a teen after his father, Steve Jobs, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, passing away while his son was an undergraduate at Stanford.\n\n\u201cAll I really care about in this world is making a huge difference for cancer patients and what we do at Yosemite, and what I\u2019ve wanted to do my entire life, is to make cancer nonlethal in our lifetimes,\u201d Jobs said onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt today.\n\nYosemite is notable not just for its focus on cancer, but also its unique structure, which Jobs says he \u201chopes other people will eventually copy.\u201d It runs a traditional venture fund, but dedicates 2.5% of it for a donor-advised fund that operates as a nonprofit entity. That capital is earmarked for grants, which Yosemite gives without taking any IP. The model was first tested out at Emerson Collective, the business and philanthropic organization founded by Jobs\u2019 mother Laurene Powell Jobs.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we\u2019re doing this is we\u2019ve really piloted this at Emerson and through partnering with the best researchers in the world on their best projects, we can not only de-risk science that we then turn into companies, but we also get a network of the best KOLs in the world,\u201d said Jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this long enough that we\u2019ve been lucky to support about 500 labs so far, and have a really big footprint across the academic ecosystem.\u201d\n\nJobs is optimistic about the development of next-generation therapies, including immunotherapies and gene-editing therapies, and how quickly they can come to fruition. He recalls that when he started working at Stanford University\u2019s cancer research labs at the age of 15 (Jobs is now 31), genomic sequencing was still relatively new. Jobs\u2019 lab used it to do research on a hereditary type of colorectal cancer that was usually lethal.\n\n\u201cWe found the mutational signatures there and basically, it had a crazy load of mutations, like millions of mutations. These cells were so out of control. But from the beginning of immunotherapy, when it began to be tested in that, the difference between those cancer cells and the rest of your body is so stark that even today\u2019s immunotherapy works marvelously in that type of colon cancer,\u201d Jobs says. \u201cIn my lifetime, I\u2019ve already seen one area go from just absolute, really poor prognosis to something that is now widely treatable and has a really great long-term survival rate.\u201d\n\nOne technology Jobs finds promising is liquid biopsies for early detection. Screening currently includes procedures like prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, mammograms and colonoscopies. \u201cThese work quite well, but for the rest of cancers, it\u2019s really a crapshoot and more often than not, things are caught when they\u2019re late and they\u2019re metastatic and far more dangerous.\u201d Things like liquid biopsies and AIs in MRIs and PTs have become very precise at picking up early cancer markers. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early days of the liquid biopsy space, but that\u2019s an area that is going to be increasingly important for catching things early. Once you do that, you just have far more options.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It doesn\u2019t need it, right? But how that works can actually now be perturbed and we can change it a bit. It turns out a lot of diseases are not caused by mutations or by the wrong gene. They\u2019re caused because gene expression goes down.\u201d\n\nThese include many autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, which happen when immune systems slow down. What epigenetic engineering can do is turn gene expression back up by creating a \u201cdial.\u201d \u201cThat dial is really interesting and you can actually touch a whole new class of diseases with it that are much more interesting than just going in and changing things,\u201d Jobs says.\n\nWhile Yosemite launched last month, Jobs has been making investments through Emerson Collective for eight years. When asked which investments he\u2019s the proudest of, Jobs mentioned two things. The first was a grant to Yale, working with their main hospital system to get clinical trial representation from across the state. \u201cIt\u2019s a small state with one of the big academic medical hubs in it, and they actually got representation to be demographically proportional, which I\u2019m really, really proud of. That\u2019s first for that entire institution.\u201d And on the company investment side, Jobs cites Tune Therapeutics in the epigenetic editing space, which is an example of the kind of company incubation that Yosemite does.\n\n\u201cWe paired up the best experts on this type of editing plus the delivery mechanisms you need to get into cells,\u201d Jobs says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even know each other. We introduced them in my living room and sketched out a business plan. I\u2019m just proud to say it\u2019s really become a leader in this space in the last three years.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he\u2019s ever thought about starting his own company, Jobs said, \u201cI think I can have much more impact doing what I\u2019m doing at this stage. Given the trends in the market, and really in science, it\u2019s really outpacing what any one company is likely able to do. I also am, you know, just innately very competitive and in my family, if you\u2019re going to start a company, it\u2019s got to be a hit.\u201d\n\nDeveloping new treatments for cancer is difficult, but Jobs is optimistic. \u201cI\u2019m all for being ambitious. Biotech is never as linear as tech, it always abounds in mystery and difficulty, which can be very exciting. What I believe is that major cancers that claim most lives are right now seeing the greatest progress and that really motivates me. That\u2019s lung, it\u2019s breast, it\u2019s prostate, colon, these are the really, really big killers. I do believe in the next 20 years, we\u2019re going to see a very significant decrease in mortality there.\u201d"}
