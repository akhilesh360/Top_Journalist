As a part of the financing, Metropolis will take on $650 million in loans and $1.05 billion in Series C preferred stock financing.\n\nMetropolis will pay roughly $1.5 billion for SP Plus \u201cwhile retaining significant capital on its balance sheet,\u201d Metropolis co-founder and CEO Alex Israel said in a press release. Prior to the latest fundraise, Metropolis had raised $226 million in total.\n\n\u201cToday, we announced a transformational acquisition that represents both a new paradigm in how technology companies grow and a significant step forward in offering consumers a remarkable experience,\u201d Israel continued. \u201cSP Plus is a phenomenal business whose operational excellence, talented leadership team and high customer satisfaction levels have long made it a key partner to real estate owners across North America. The combined platform will seek to bring checkout-free payment experiences to consumers.\u201d\n\nIsrael, a serial entrepreneur who sold his last company, ParkMe, to Intrix in 2015, founded Metropolis in 2017. The company equips existing parking structures with a computer vision system that enables customers to \u201cdrive in and drive out\u201d without having to swipe a credit card or pay with cash.\n\nTo use a Metropolis parking facility, customers have to provide their name, license plate, phone number and payment method. From an app, they can review their visit and know the price in real time. Metropolis tracks cars and automatically charges the owners, emailing the receipt after they drive out.\n\nIn SP Plus, Metropolis gains an established, publicly traded business with a massive parking footprint across the U.S. and Canada. SP Plus owns more than two million parking spaces and manages over 3,300 parking facility locations, as well as parking and shuttle bus operations at 160 airports.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Following its acquisition of Premier Parking last year, a Nashville-based company that operates parking garages and spaces around the U.S., and now SP Plus, Metropolis claims to have operations in more than 360 cities, millions of customers and over $4 billion in processed payments annually.\n\n\u201cWhile transforming the parking experience is our focus and priority today, as we deploy our proven technology we see opportunity to offer checkout-free transaction experiences at even more places people go,\u201d Israel said in the press release. \u201cFrom gas and electric vehicle-charging stations to drive-thrus and car washes, as well as retail stores, our computer vision platform enables people to transact in the physical world with even greater ease than we experience online.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Metropolis has stepped up investment on the analytics, sales and marketing side of the business, where it sees a large addressable market. For example, the startup \u2014 which recently announced a team-up with Uber to launch Uber Park \u2014 uses insights from its platform to inform staffing, pricing and maintenance at parking facilities, also partnering with local businesses like grocery stores, coffee shops and other merchants for in-app promotions.\n\n\u201cThis transaction delivers immediate and certain value to our stockholders at a substantial premium to current and historical trading levels,\u201d SP Plus chairman and chief executive Marc Baumann said in a statement. \u201cWe expect the transaction to offer an exciting path forward for our team members, partners, clients and consumers in the U.S. and abroad. While our technology offerings are successfully fulfilling client and market demand, with increased investment, we see the opportunity to accelerate the technology roadmap for the benefit of our clients and their customers.\u201d\n\nAt $54 per share in cash, Metropolis\u2019 acquisition \u2014 which will take SP Plus private \u2014 represents a 52% premium over SP Plus\u2019 closing stock price on October 4. The transaction has been unanimously approved by Metropolis\u2019 and SP Plus\u2019 boards of directors and is expected to close in 2024, the companies say, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and the approval of SP Plus\u2019 stockholders.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many of SP Plus\u2019 approximately 20,000 team members will join Los Angeles-based Metropolis\u2019 workforce, which totals around 2,000 employees, following the deal."}
