Carbone said:\n\n\"These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it's stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it's a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote.\"\n\nThe Guiding and Establishing National Innovation in U.S. Stablecoins of 2025, or GENIUS Act, is seen as a critical piece of legislation. Failing to pass comprehensive regulatory reform before the midterm elections in 2026 could mean a reversal in the positive regulatory environment and a downturn in the crypto markets.\n\n\"Negotiations have continued, and so I am still very optimistic,\u201d Carbone said. \u201cThis bill is going to pass the Senate in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nThe GENIUS Act of 2025.
