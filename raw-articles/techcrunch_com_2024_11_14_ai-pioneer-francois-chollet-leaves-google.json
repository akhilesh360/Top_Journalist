A post on Google\u2019s developer blog notes that Keras has over 2 million users and powers a number of high-profile tech products, like Waymo\u2019s self-driving cars, as well as the recommendation engines on YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify.\n\nIn 2019, Chollet published the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark, which measures the ability of AI systems to solve novel reasoning problems. This year, he launched the ARC Prize, a $1 million competition to beat ARC-AGI. (It remains unwon.)\n\nChollet has often argued that the approach taken by many of the major labs developing AI \u2014 feeding ever more data and computational resources to models \u2014 won\u2019t achieve AI that\u2019s as \u201csmart\u201d as humans. Instead, he thinks that methods that help models to \u201creason\u201d in more human-like ways, like neuro-symbolic AI, are the most promising path forward.\n\nIn 2021, Chollet won the Global Swiss AI Award for breakthroughs in AI. And in September, he was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in AI.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
