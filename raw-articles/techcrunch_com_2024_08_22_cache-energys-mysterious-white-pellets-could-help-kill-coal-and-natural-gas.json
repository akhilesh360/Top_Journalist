Sometimes they\u2019ll even pay the owners of other power plants not to generate electricity.\n\nIn response, scientists and engineers have been racing to find inexpensive ways to store that power for later, ultimately hoping to store renewable energy so that it\u2019s available 24/7 and at a price that\u2019ll put coal and natural gas out of business.\n\nCache Energy is the latest startup to attempt the feat, and it\u2019s taking a slightly different tack than most. Rather than store power as heat using sand or specially made bricks, Cache is storing it in chemical bonds inside pellets made of lime derived from limestone. Founder and CEO Arpit Dwivedi likes to call the approach \u201ccoal without consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a low-cost solid that is able to produce heat and can use some of the similar infrastructure built around fossil fuel,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nDwivedi said that the pellets can be stored in piles or silos, moved around using conveyor belts and transported via rail cars. \u201cAs long as you physically contain it \u2014 it could literally be a tarp \u2014 that is enough to hold its charge almost forever.\u201d\n\nCache Energy\u2019s pellets can be stored in simple containers without losing charge.

Dwivedi started the company in 2021, shortly before finishing his PhD at the University of Illinois, and he gave TechCrunch an exclusive look at Cache\u2019s technology, which seeks to replace fossil fuel\u2019s role in providing heat to homes and industries.\n\nThe startup begins with calcium hydroxide, a widely available material that\u2019s used in everything from paper making and sewage treatment to pickling and nixtamalization, the process that turns cornmeal into masa for tortillas. On its own, calcium hydroxide is a powdery substance, which isn\u2019t ideal for Cache\u2019s process. If the granule size is too small, it\u2019s liable to blow away, so the company figured out how to bind the powder so it holds up over time.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That\u2019s the \u201ccharged\u201d state for the battery. To discharge, Cache feeds the pellets through the same gravity-fed reactor, suffusing them with moisture to reverse the reaction and produce heat. The overall efficiency of the system is around 95%, Dwivedi said.\n\nCache\u2019s pellets can produce heat at up to 550 degrees C, which would cover the bulk of industrial processes as well as the heat and hot water needs of commercial and residential buildings. Dwivedi said one shipping container worth of Cache\u2019s pellets would be enough to get a couple office buildings through the winter. The company is working on a new version that will be able to generate heat at up to 900 degrees C, widening the range of industries it can sell to.\n\nThe startup recently raised $8.5 million in seed funding, and it\u2019s looking to raise a Series A by the end of the year. Investors in the seed round include Cantos, Climate Capital, Evergreen Climate Innovations, Grantham Foundation, Halliburton Labs, Muus Climate Partners, Unshackled Ventures and Voyager Ventures. The startup has one pilot reactor that\u2019s currently with a customer, and Dwivedi said future funds would go toward shipping more reactors to customers.\n\nCache\u2019s goal is to keep the costs of its equipment and materials as low as possible. It\u2019s using as many off-the-shelf parts as possible, and even at its current hourly production rate of about 500 kilowatt-hours, the pellets themselves only cost about 20 to 40 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\nWhether Cache can be competitive with fossil fuels depends heavily on how much electricity costs. Where wind and solar are plentiful, the pellets could be charged on the cheap. Like any arbitrage opportunity, the key is to buy as low as possible.\n\nIf Cache\u2019s pellets can withstand the rigors of real-world use, it\u2019s possible to envision them being charged in regions where solar and wind are plentiful, like Texas or Arizona, and shipped around the country to help run industrial facilities or heat office buildings. \u201cEven a basement of a house, if needed, can host and store it,\u201d Dwivedi said. Imagine a Cache truck delivering pellets before the start of every winter, just like heating oil trucks still do in the Northeast. It could go a long way toward decarbonizing heat, one of fossil fuel\u2019s last bastions.\n\nUpdate: Added Cantos as an investor."}
