Holographic is a term used almost without break as scientists and engineers pitch giants like 3M and GE with technologies that won\u2019t be consumer-ready for a decade. And of course, there\u2019s the always-popular \u201cnano.\u201d In this case, it\u2019s nanodots, or quantum dots, so-called because at 6-10nm across, they\u2019re small enough that quantum effects need to be consulted when working with them. \u2026that\u2019s what she said.\n\nThe dots themselves are actually \u201csingle, defect-free crystals\u201d acting as magnetic switches, somehow, and they can be packed in with incredible density, resulting in chips where an area of about 3x3cm would store a terabyte. Now, to be honest, that\u2019s more impressive than incredible; the promises of holographic tech are much more insane, due to the fact that the data is not limited to a flat plane.\n\nWill we ever see this technology in practice? Well, the inventor says five years or less. So we\u2019ll check back in five years, and see where the goalposts have moved to.\n\n[via Tom\u2019s Hardware]"}
