But when he moved to the U.S. in 2013, his wife was less enthusiastic about him continuing down that path.\n\n\u201cMy wife didn\u2019t want me working on high voltage anymore for safety reasons,\u201d Barat told TechCrunch.\n\nSo he went back to school, eventually getting his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from UC Berkeley.\n\nBut he just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about power lines. Or rather, listening to them.\n\n\u201cAs humans, we can\u2019t sense electricity. We can feel it. We can get electrocuted,\u201d Barat said. Neither of those are conducive to a long career, though. So instead, electric company linemen use their other senses to get a handle on what\u2019s happening during an outage.\n\n\u201cGenerally, we\u2019re looking, we\u2019re listening. We\u2019re feeling transformers vibrating differently, things like that. We hit a pole with a hammer and listen to how it sounds, the ringing afterwards, to tell if it\u2019s hollow before we climb it for safety reasons.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a laborious and time-consuming process. Utility workers often have to traverse dozens of miles to trace the origin of an outage, whether it be a tree branch resting on a wire, a squirrel that got fried when it grounded a line, or a line downed by high winds. Only once they report the nature and exact location of the problem can the repair work begin.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company\u2019s product is a device that literally listens for electrical problems.\n\n\u201cWe think of the grid like a giant guitar as opposed to a circuit board,\u201d Barat said. \u201cIt\u2019s a physical thing. We need to be monitoring the physical attributes of the grid, too, not just voltage and current.\u201d\n\nWires, poles, and transformers make different sounds depending on whether they\u2019ve been hit by tree limbs, struck by cars, or buffeted by winds. Gridware\u2019s sensors, which are mounted on the pole just below the lines, aren\u2019t connected to the wires themselves. Instead they\u2019re waiting for mechanical perturbations \u2014 sounds and vibrations \u2014 that the company\u2019s AI and signal processing software have been trained to identify as different hazards to the grid.\n\nProcessing happens on each device, and when the software identifies a likely problem, it sends the details and location to the cloud through cellular or satellite connections (or, if the signal is weak, to another device to relay the message). The entire box is about the size of an iPad, and it\u2019s powered by solar panels, with its base angled to allow those panels to face the sun. Because they don\u2019t touch the power lines or need a separate power source, the devices are quick to install: Power lines can remain energized, and each box takes less than 15 minutes to mount and enable.\n\nBarat said Gridware was cash-flow positive last year, but he felt it was still an opportune time to raise money. Gridware recently closed a $26.4 million Series A led by Sequoia, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Existing investors Convective Capital, Fifty Years, Lowercarbon Capital, and True Ventures participated. \u201cThis raise was significantly easier in that we didn\u2019t need it,\u201d he said.\n\nGridware currently monitors over 1,000 miles of power lines for 18 companies from devices on 10,000 poles. The company previously worked with PG&E and ConEd to ensure the devices accurately report problems in the field.\n\nBut before Barat could get onto utilities\u2019 poles, he needed to prove to himself that Gridware\u2019s devices worked.\n\n\u201cI built my own grid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s full size, 55-foot poles, 200-foot spans, and I spent years destroying it in every way, shape and form. I\u2019ve had so many people watch how I blow up transformers, throw trees onto power lines, cut live power lines with bolt cutters \u2014 really doing a lot of risky activities to emulate those events.\u201d\n\nHow did his wife feel about that? \u201cI got in trouble,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cthat\u2019s behind us because we\u2019re getting generally three to four events a day in the real world.\u201d"}
