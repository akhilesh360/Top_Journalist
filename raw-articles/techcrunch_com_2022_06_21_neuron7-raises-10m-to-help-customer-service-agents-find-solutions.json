Owing to burnout, flexibility and customer satisfaction challenges, agents are quitting at a faster rate than in the past \u2014 a problematic trend in a high-turnover industry. According to a February 2022 Salesforce report, 71% of customer service agents have considered leaving their job in the past six months. The impact is becoming clear. Forrester\u2019s annual study on customer service found that 19% of brands in the year through April 2022 saw their customer experience rating fall \u2014 the highest proportion to drop in one year since the study\u2019s inception.\n\nVinay Saini and Niken Patel, the co-founders of Neuron7, say that they observed this firsthand \u2014 Patel in advisory roles at Deloitte and Fujitsu and Saini as the CFO and COO at Oracle software partner Serene. (Patel also worked at Serene, moving his way up from the role of EVP to CEO.) According to Patel, the organizations he and Saini consulted with often collected massive amounts of customer service data yet struggled to use it effectively, leading the data to become stale and unused.\n\n\u201cThe real insight on how to [address customer] issues was spread across multiple silos \u2014 and, usually, in experts\u2019 heads,\u201d Patel told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThey\u2019d spend tons building knowledge bases and search applications on top of the data, but those systems just weren\u2019t sophisticated enough to find resolutions to customer issues quickly and consistently.\u201d\n\nFrustration led Saini and Patel in 2020 to launch Neuron7, a startup that parses customer service records to help agents and technicians resolve product issues. As Patel describes it, Neuron7 uses natural language processing to guide users step by step, analyzing metadata from knowledge bases, product documentation, customer support call logs and transcripts to create a \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that can help diagnose and solve problems.\n\nNeuron7 isn\u2019t the first to market with a recommendation engine for customer service \u2014 far from it. Beyond incumbents like Salesforce, the vendor has rivals in Zingtree and Talla, which combines customer content with automation and machine learning to help agents get at information they need. Ultimate.ai also provides an AI-driven service that delivers real-time help to staff dealing with customer queries.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the segment is rife with competition. According to one estimate, customer service is a $350 billion-a-year industry \u2014 and the stakes are high. Ninety percent of Americans responding to a 2020 Microsoft said that they use customer service as a factor in deciding whether to do business with a company; 58% said they\u2019ll switch companies because of poor customer service.\n\nBut Patel notes that Neuron7 can power self-service portals for both customers and employees beyond the customer service division. That\u2019s one differentiator, in his mind \u2014 the other being Neuron7\u2019s algorithmic innovations. Investors were evidently won over by the pitch, with Battery Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners co-leading Neuron7\u2019s $10 million Series A (which closed today).\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

To inform future recommendations, the platform also tries to capture how technicians diagnose and solve issues, in part by monitoring data streams from relevant connected devices.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s important for AI to go way beyond analytics and high-level AI predictions. We don\u2019t want to just give a report card that shows how service organization is doing \u2014 we want to help change the report card by impacting the most crucial service metrics,\u201d Patel said. \u201cCustomer service data is often siloed across geographic locations, product areas and even within different customer service departments and systems. Neuron7 solves an expensive problem for IT, by putting it to work without developing custom search applications or funding expensive data integration and curation projects \u2026 The beauty of AI is that it continuously improves with each outcome \u2014 nothing ever gets stale.\u201d\n\nPatel didn\u2019t reveal the number of customers Neuron7 is currently servicing, but named Sofftek, an IT and business process consultancy, as one of them. He said that the proceeds from the Series A will go toward client acquisition efforts as well as expanding Neuron7\u2019s 20-person workforce, with a focus on the go-to-market and product teams.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic hit customer service organizations very hard by increasing employee turnover, and with each departure, years of expertise leave the team. It also forced companies to not roll trucks and send field service engineers on site, unless absolutely necessary,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThese situations make customer service productivity and collective intelligence building tools like Neuron7 extremely valuable due to its ability to make new employees as productive as experts and to increase customer service KPIs across all tiers of service. Unless customer service productivity and profitability go out of style, Neuron7 will be fine.\u201d\n\nNeuron7 has raised a total of $14.7 million to date inclusive of the Series A."}
