He felt they discouraged his investments in AI. \u201cThey actually said flat out to us, \u2018don\u2019t do AI startups like, don\u2019t fund AI startups,\u201d he said.\n\nObviously, we don\u2019t know how the other folks in the meeting would recall such discussions, or even who he met with. But we can understand why such thoughts would be frightening for Andreessen in particular: His firm has backed AI startups like Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, Mistral AI, and Character.AI.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in June 2023, long before these meetings, Andreessen published an AI manifesto called \u201cWhy AI will save the world\u201d in which he warned against AI regulation. So this is an area that\u2019s been on his mind for a while.\n\nPublicly, the administration has enacted less drastic measures around AI than what Andreessen recalled. In October 2023, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that contained a series of voluntary commitments for AI companies to follow. This included asking companies to share safety test results with the government and called upon Congress to evaluate how AI companies were gathering data.\n\nThe order got mixed reviews from Silicon Valley at the time. OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman tweeted that, while there were \u201csome great parts\u201d to the initiative, \u201cit will be important not to slow down innovation by smaller companies/research teams.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Earlier this month, Trump declared that investor VC David Sacks would be his AI and crypto czar, after which both Altman and Perplexity confirmed they would donate $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund. \u201cPresident Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\u201d Altman said in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nAndreessen himself has spent about half his time in Mar-a-Lago since the election. He confirmed to Weiss the speculation that he was involved in Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE initiative, describing himself as an \u201can unpaid volunteer.\u201d He also said that, at Mar-a-Lago, he\u2019s \u201cbeen involved in some of the interviewing process for some of the officials coming in.\u201d\n\nAndreessen said he felt hopeful about Trump\u2019s approach to tech, saying Trump told him, \u201cI don\u2019t know much about tech, but I don\u2019t need to, because you guys know a lot about it. You guys should go build tech companies. The American tech companies should win.\u201d"}
