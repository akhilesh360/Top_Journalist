Launched on Monday, this tool lets educators create a list of questions based on specific text input.\n\nUsing this text-dependent question-generation tool, which utilizes Gemini, teachers can either upload files from Google Drive or manually enter text for the AI to generate questions. They can then export the questions into a Google Doc or Google Form.\n\nEducators can choose from a variety of filters, including the grade level, the number of questions, and the type of questions (such as multiple choice or open-ended). Additionally, there is an option for teachers to specify the skills they want their students to demonstrate, such as the use of figurative language or the ability to evaluate arguments.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nThis feature is available only to Google Workspace for Education subscribers who have either the Gemini Education add-on ($24 per user) or Gemini Education Premium ($36 per user).\n\nGoogle initially launched Gemini to Classroom in 2024 and has since expanded its capabilities. The recent update included a tool for creating vocabulary lists. It can also generate lesson plan ideas and summarize a range of materials, from class notes to student feedback."}
