You just need to connect your bank account first.\n\nZuckerberg claims this could be one of the most valuable AI systems ever built, generating thousands of image ads and testing them in real time, but it raises a bigger question: Is this the future of advertising, or just another wave of AI slop flooding your feed?\n\nToday, on TechCrunch\u2019s Equity podcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha are unpacking why Zuckerberg\u2019s vision could be a marketer\u2019s dream or creative agency\u2019s worst nightmare, and what else caught our eye in tech this week.\n\nListen to the full episode to hear about:\n\nEquity will be back next week, so stay tuned!\n\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.
