Musk said Tesla will launch a robotaxi service in Austin this summer and California at some point this year.\n\nWaymo already operates a commercial service in Phoenix, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and more recently Austin, in partnership with ride-hail firm Uber. Waymo also intends to launch a robotaxi service via Uber in Atlanta this year and has already begun ferrying employees in fully autonomous vehicles in the city. Miami is next on Waymo\u2019s public launch list for 2026, alongside Washington, D.C.\n\nTo raise even more enthusiasm and awareness, Waymo has said it plans to begin mapping in 10 cities this year, including Las Vegas, San Diego, and, as of Monday, Nashville.\n\nWaymo\u2019s Washington, D.C., announcement comes two months after the company launched a small test fleet of its Jaguar I-Pace robotaxis in the city, where it\u2019s been driving manually and testing autonomously with a safety driver behind the wheel.\n\nWaymo\u2019s business model is contingent upon removing the human driver from the vehicle. The company said it will work with policymakers to update the district\u2019s permitting rules to allow for fully autonomous vehicles to drive on public roads."}
