Futures OI increasing alongside the price indicates bullish sentiment.\n\nXRP futures open interest.

For example, the current scenario mirrors the XRP price pump in the run-up to US President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, leading to a 70% rally from a low of $1.99 on Dec. 31, 2024, to a seven-year high of $3.40 on Jan. 16.\n\nRelated: Is the XRP price rally over for now?\n\nWhile XRP funding rates have flipped positive, they remain relatively neutral, around 0.0065%, indicating balanced market sentiment despite growing speculation.\n\nXRP funding rates. Source: CoinGlass\n\nXRP price chart paints V-shaped recovery\n\nXRP\u2019s price action has been forming a V-shaped recovery pattern on the weekly candle chart since mid-January, as shown below.\n\nA V-shaped recovery is a bullish pattern formed when an asset experiences a sharp price increase after a steep decline. It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline.\n\nXRP appears to be on such a trajectory, and bulls need to flip $2.60 back into support in order to increase the chances of the price rising to $3.00. Higher than that, the next logical move would be the neckline at $3.40 to complete the V-shaped pattern. This would represent a 40% increase from the current price.\n\nXRP/USD daily chart.
