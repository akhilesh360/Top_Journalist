Just last week, researchers from Stanford and the University of Washington demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to train a highly capable \u201creasoning\u201d model for under $50 in cloud compute credits, a stark contrast to the costs often associated with OpenAI\u2019s models.\n\nTechCrunch\u2019s Kirsten Korosec, Margaux MacColl, and Max Zeff are diving into the biggest news on today\u2019s episode of Equity, including how the tide could be changing for OpenAI.\n\nListen to the full episode to hear about:\n\nEquity will be back next week, so don\u2019t miss it!\n\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.
