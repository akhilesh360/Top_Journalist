This means that every person setting up Siri will choose a voice for themselves and it will no longer default to the voice assistant being female, a topic that has come up quite a bit with regards to bias in voice interfaces over the past few years.\n\nThe beta version should be live now and available to program participants.\n\nI believe that this is the first of these assistants to make the choice completely agnostic with no default selection made. This is a positive step forward as it allows people to choose the voice that they prefer without the defaults bias coming into play. The two new voices also bring some much needed variety to the voices of Siri, offering more diversity in speech sound and pattern to a user picking a voice that speaks to them.\n\nIn some countries and languages Siri already defaults to a male voice. But this change makes the choice the users\u2019 for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,\u201d a statement from Apple reads. \u201cThis is a continuation of Apple\u2019s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.\u201d\n\nThe two new voices use source talent recordings that are then run through Apple\u2019s Neural text to speech engine, making the voices flow more organically through phrases that are actually being generated on the fly.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the new voices and they sound pretty fantastic, with natural inflection and smooth transitions. They\u2019ll be a welcome addition of choice to iOS users. Here are some samples of the voices in action:\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Siri now handles 25 billion requests per month on over 500 million devices and supports 21 languages in 36 countries.\n\nThe new voices are available to English-speaking users around the world and Siri users can select a personal preference of voice in 16 languages.\n\nIt seems very likely that these two new voices are just the first expansion in Siri\u2019s voice selections. More diversity in voice, tone and regional dialect can only be a positive development for how inclusive smart devices feel. Over the past few years we have finally begun to see some movement from Amazon, Google and Apple to aggressively correct situations where the assistants have revealed bias in their responses to queries that use negative or abusive language. Improvements there, as well as in queries on social justice topics and overall accessibility improvements, are incredibly key as we continue to see an explosion of voice-first or voice-native interfaces. These kinds of choices matter, especially at a scale of hundreds of millions of people.\n\nArticle updated to note that in some countries and languages Siri currently defaults to a male voice."}
