Notably, the amount of the Series C financing is greater than the combined $160 million the company has raised since its 2017 inception.\n\nLoft Orbital declined to reveal its valuation. According to PitchBook, its post-money valuation at the time of its last raise in 2021 \u2014 a $130 million Series B round \u2014 was $550 million.\n\nBpifrance, Foundation Capital, Temasek, and Uncork Capital also participated, which brings the company\u2019s total raised over its lifetime to $330 million.\n\nLoft also declined to reveal hard revenue figures but co-founder and COO Alex Greenberg told TechCrunch that the company has grown revenue by 100% two years in a row.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve achieved over $500 million of bookings on only $160 million of capital raised prior to this Series C. In an industry known for its capital intensity, we are proud of our capital efficiency,\u201d he added. \u201cRight now we\u2019re really focused on profitability and getting the business to sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe company has sold over 30 satellites and its customers include NASA, Microsoft, Anduril, and BAE Systems, among others. In total, it says it has deployed over 25 customer missions across its five satellites launched to date.\n\nWhen it started in January 2017, the company\u2019s self-described mission was to \u201cmake it simple for organizations to deploy and operate missions in space.\u201d In a nutshell, Loft aims to handle the process of deploying and operating customer missions as a service.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The startup last August announced a joint venture with Abu Dhabi-based Marlan Space that raised over $100 million from a holding company affiliated with an Emirati royal family to grow the region\u2019s domestic satellite manufacturing capabilities.\n\nIt also says it has launched YAM-6, a satellite dedicated to running AI in space.\n\nGreenberg said Loft will use its new capital in two ways. It plans to scale from launching a handful of satellites per year to ten-plus annually. It also wants to expand its virtual missions, expand its AI business where customers can create an AI system in their own cloud (wildfire detection for instance), and deploy it onto a Loft satellite. And he hopes to grow an ecosystem of AI application partners."}
