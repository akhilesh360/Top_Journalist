This logistical dance can take up to an hour to fill a trailer, leaving truck drivers in idle limbo.\n\nThe founders of Atlanta-based Slip Robotics say they\u2019ve developed a robot that cuts that time down to five minutes. Their design inspiration: the floor.\n\nSlip Robotics, which was founded in 2020 by Chris Smith, Dennis Siedlak, and John Jakomin, has developed and launched a commercial robot-as-a-service business that combines automation software and large floor-like robotic platforms that can hold 10 palettes and carry up to 12,000 pounds. According to the company, these so-called SlipBots can handle uneven ground and navigate routes from the warehouse floor into a truck trailer. Three SlipBots \u2014 about 36,000 pounds of payload \u2014 fit into one truck trailer. Once the truck arrives at its destination, the SlipBots disembark.\n\nThe idea behind SlipBots came, in part, from Smith\u2019s collective experience at former employers Cummins, Tesla, and Volley Automation, the latter a robotics startup that developed automated car park systems. His time at Tesla, where he led factory simulation and analytics and was one of the first 50 engineers at the Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada, was particularly influential.\n\nAll of this led to a singular thought, \u201cWhat if I built the floor, but it moves?\u201d Freight is typically set down on the floor for staging, where it\u2019s picked up by forklifts. Smith\u2019s idea was for that freight to be set down on robotic floor-like platforms that could move everything at once.\n\nAfter three years of development and testing, Slip Robotics launched its commercial service in 2023. Today, there are hundreds of SlipBots being used in facilities across more than 25 sites that range from 20,000 square feet to more than 2 million square feet in size, Chief Commercial Officer Jordan Sanders told TechCrunch. Its customers include John Deere, GE Appliances, Valeo, and Nissan.\n\nSlip Robotics customers pay a subscription license fee for the use of SlipBots, with ongoing software updates, hardware service, maintenance, and repairs included. Sanders said customers typically have a \u201cthree, three, three\u201d setup. This means a customer will always have three bots on a dock, three in transit, and three waiting at the destination.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Just a few weeks ago, Slip Robotics closed on $28 million in Series B funding, the company announced on Tuesday. The round was led by DCVC and saw participation from existing investors Eve Atlas, Tech Square Ventures, Hyde Park Venture Partners, Overline, and Pathbreaker Ventures. James Hardiman of DCVC has joined the board, which includes Slip co-founders and Thiago Olson, managing partner of EVE Atlas.\n\nThe company has raised $45 million, to date. Slip didn\u2019t share its valuation.\n\nSanders said the new capital will be used to hire more employees, increase deployments, and enhance its product offerings. He emphasized that Slip Robotics\u2019 success so far is a credit not only to the product but how the startup chose to scale.\n\n\u201cPeople have come to expect a lot of hype and \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d from robotics companies about their actual state of technology development and actual commercial scale,\u201d Sanders noted in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cThis expectation and implicit skepticism is unfortunate, but it is entirely justified based on the hype and failed promises over the last decade.\u201d\n\nHe said Slip Robotics didn\u2019t try to scale too soon, kept quiet, and focused on developing its robotics platform. That approach appears to have paid off. The company, once less than a dozen people, has now grown to about 50 employees. Importantly, he noted, Slip Robotics now has 10 commercial customers and hundreds of bots in the field.\n\n\u201cIf you have more engineers in your office than revenue-generating vehicles in the real world, you don\u2019t have a real business,\u201d Sanders quipped."}
