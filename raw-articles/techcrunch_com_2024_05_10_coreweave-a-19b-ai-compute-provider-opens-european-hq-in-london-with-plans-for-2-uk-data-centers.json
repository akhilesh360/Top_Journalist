Hot on the heels of a mega funding round valuing the GPU cloud company at a reported $19 billion, the New Jersey startup has opened an office in London that will serve as its European headquarters.\n\nAdditionally, Coreweave said that it will open two data centers in the U.K. this year as part of a \u00a31 billion ($1.25 billion) investment, its first outside the U.S.\n\nFounded in 2017, CoreWeave is one of a number of AI-focused cloud computing companies to benefit from the recent surge in AI, including the generative AI hype prompted by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. CoreWeave offers access to cloud-based AI \u201ccompute,\u201d which is the infrastructure and resources required to carry out computational tasks such as processing data and running machine learning models.\n\nDevelopers building AI applications need access to GPUs (graphics processing units), which are complex to set up and manage, and are expensive to run, as they are typically rented for a set period of time. CoreWeave makes this processing power available on-demand and at scale, serving up a range of Nvidia GPUs to cater to developers\u2019 various use cases.\n\nA number of players have emerged in this nascent space \u2014 and they\u2019re getting funded, too. Lambda raised a chunky $320 million a few months ago, and last month, French startup FlexAI emerged from stealth with $30 million but with a focus on deploying AI models across multiple architectures, not just Nvidia.\n\nCoreWeave is among the frontrunners in the GPU cloud space. Last week it said it had raised $1.1 billion in a round that nearly tripled its valuation from the previously reported $7 billion figure in December. Such is the AI gold rush, and Nvidia itself has seen its market capitalization quadruple over the past 12 months to more than $2 trillion.\n\nU.K. and AI\n\nThe U.K. is considered among the top countries for R&D investment in AI, behind the U.S. and China. Google\u2019s DeepMind is based in London, and Microsoft recently made a $3.15 billion commitment to build its AI infrastructure in the country over the next few years as well. The Redmond, Washington-based giant\u2019s newly formed consumer AI division also gained its first international hub in London, and it\u2019s fronted by former Inflection and DeepMind scientist, Jordan Hoffmann.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Given CoreWeave\u2019s plans to open two U.K. data centers by the end of this year, it\u2019s safe to say the company was probably already working on these plans before today\u2019s announcement.\n\nIt also means by the end of 2024, CoreWeave will have 28 data centers operating globally, though the company wouldn\u2019t say how many it has today. It did have 14 at the end of 2023, all of which were in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing unprecedented demand for AI infrastructure and London is an important AI hub that we are investing in,\u201d CoreWeave\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Mike Intrator, said in a statement. \u201cExpanding our physical footprint in the U.K. is an important milestone in the next phase of CoreWeave\u2019s growth.\u201d"}
