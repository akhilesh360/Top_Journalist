(According to a recent Gallup poll, 7.1% of Americans identify as LGBT+.)\n\nThat\u2019s a staggeringly low amount of funding, although not surprising when considering how homophobia and transphobia could easily slip in and prevent investors from giving money to those they don\u2019t support or understand.\n\nKate Anthony, the founder of the app Euphoria, which connects individuals to gender-affirming healthcare resources, said her fundraising journey was awful and \u201creally difficult.\u201d Investors didn\u2019t understand how big the trans population was or why her company was needed. She also faced a lot of bias.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a 50-50 chance when I speak to someone they don\u2019t want to see someone like me existing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was a game of immense trial and error,\u201d she said, adding that she pitched 272 investors and got 12 on Euphoria\u2019s pre-seed cap table. She wants to raise an official seed round, though she is hesitant given the economic climate, not to mention the bias she will likely continue to face as a trans founder. \u201cIt\u2019s just depressing and demoralizing.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch conducted an investigation into current market sentiment \u2014 what we like to call a \u201cvibe check\u201d \u2014 to see what it is like for trans founders looking for venture capital money, specifically when their product targets the trans community. Many said investors often distrust their product\u2019s market potential, while others described an emotional process of outing themselves in every meeting to people who may or may not support their existence.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Anthony said increased investor support would be \u201cundoubtedly\u201d significant as it would increase innovation in the space and therefore lead to products that address critical issues like transitioning and access to mental health services.\n\n\u201cAs existing as a trans person gets more challenging, those services will become increasingly \u2014 and regrettably \u2014 necessary,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cIf there were more trans tech out there, it\u2019d be harder to justify crafting legislation that outlawed specific services and industries as that could create economic fallout.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand that the trans community is huge\u201d\n\nAydian Dowling, the founder of the app Trace, is in the middle of raising a pre-seed round.\n\nHe said the most significant challenge he\u2019s faced so far is proving to investors that the LGBTQ community is worth investing in and one deserving of the opportunities cisgender and perceived straight founders are given.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand that the trans community is huge,\u201d Dowling told TechCrunch. The data isn\u2019t broken down, but the overall LGBTQ+ community is estimated to have spending power topping $1.4 trillion. \u201cWe\u2019re growing every single year, and just because you might not know someone directly doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nDowling said that trans businesses have to spend a lot of time educating investors on the importance of their products, which is time-consuming compared to the fact that other founders \u2014 cis, straight-appearing white men, in particular \u2014 can dive right into explaining their product. This aspect is daunting and risky for trans founders.\n\n\u201cEvery time I step into a room, I have to out myself as a transgender person, whether that\u2019s safe or not in the room,\u201d Dowling continued. \u201cThey might say they\u2019re very open and diverse as a fund, but what do I know if they actually are, right?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Anthony said she begged for investor introductions and said the number of rejections and ghostings she received was astronomical. Once in the room, she spent most of her time describing the importance of her product, constantly having to explain what gender transitioning is and why access to proper care is essential. Most couldn\u2019t understand the scope.\n\n\u201cInvestors would be so hamstrung by the complexities of this patient population that we wouldn\u2019t even be able to pitch our product,\u201d Anthony continued. \u201cIt was a compounding problem that, despite Euphoria\u2019s current metrics, we\u2019re still deeply underestimated as a company.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Billie Simmons, the founder of the LGBTQ+ fintech app Daylight, said the company closed its seed round last year. There was some distrust from investors, though she said the company found ways to challenge most misconceptions.\n\n\u201cI think me being trans and my co-founders being gay helped us with fundraising,\u201d Simmons told TechCrunch. \u201cThey trust we know our community and what our community needs better than anyone, and that comes largely from belonging to that community and experiencing firsthand the problem that we\u2019re trying to solve.\u201d\n\nTransGuySupply co-founder Auston Bjorkman also hopes for community support as his company gears up for its fundraising efforts. He said so little attention is given to trans-owned companies, making it difficult for his startup even to begin a conversation with investors.\n\n\u201cThey have never even thought about trans and non-binary people, much less considered that there is a viable market,\u201d Bjorkman told TechCrunch. \u201cThey don\u2019t see us [as] legitimate founders, business owners, designers, thought [leaders], culture and community makers because they don\u2019t see us at all.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s already preparing to show his company has substantial market value, profitability and a growing year-over-year business. Bjorkman hopes his company\u2019s strong consumer base will be enough to sway some investors. Dowling pointed out that many of the investors that have taken first and second meetings with his company tend to be younger and more understanding of the issues the trans community faces compared to older investors.\n\nRocco Kayiatos, a former executive at the telemedicine service Folx Health, said that younger people are, more than ever, identifying as members of the LGBTQ+ community, thus helping to push and normalize the need for more businesses catering to their needs. There have already been big-name success stories regarding LGBTQ-focused companies receiving venture funds.\n\n\u201cFor too long, the trans community specifically has relied on individuals who have enough energy to start something, but when those individuals don\u2019t have the financial backing to build, support staff or think 10 years ahead, then there is a loss of momentum,\u201d Kayiatos told TechCrunch. \u201cSeeing VCs start to invest gives me hope that we\u2019ll have businesses well into the future, succeed and continue to support this community.\u201d\n\nHe said the next step is for trans entrepreneurs to come together and support each other so they can build and sustain businesses outside of the nonprofit industrial complex. Overall, for the fundraising experience for trans founders to improve, Anthony said investors need to start conducting their own research regarding the community so they can better understand the issues and pressing need for innovation in trans tech.\n\nShe also wants to see investors take more meetings and, as she put it simply, invest more in the community.\n\n\u201cCut me a check,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThat\u2019s the short answer.\u201d"}
