Alternatively, you can step into a room that someone else has scanned and shared.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed a \u201chyperscape\u201d onstage of rock band Green Day\u2019s studio.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also bringing photorealistic spaces to the metaverse, and we call this hyperscape,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty wild, and we\u2019re planning on just adding more and more over time.\u201d\n\nA Meta blog post explains more:\n\n\u201cBy utilizing Gaussian Splatting, a 3D volume rendering technique, we can take advantage of cloud rendering and streaming to make these spaces viewable on a standalone Quest 3 headset,\u201d the post reads. \u201cIn the future, creators will be able to build worlds within [our VR platform] Horizon.\u201d\n\nHyperscape is compatible with the Quest 3 and Quest 3S."}
