Previously, Meinshausen co-launched PaySense, an India-based micro-loan app that was acquired by PayU, the Netherlands-based payment service provider, in 2019 for $185 million. He met Wheeler through a U.S. Army Department of Intelligence program in 2009, and the pair came into contact with Abboud at DT One, the telecom payments API business, where Abboud was then the chief product officer.\n\n\u201cAampe was founded at the intersection of two major changes happening in the industry: privacy-driven changes to performance adtech and marketing, and AI,\u201d Meinshausen said.\n\nWhat\u2019s that mean, concretely? As Meinshausen explained to me via email, Aampe plugs into a mobile app to collect metrics like how much users are spending on in-app purchases and the typical makeup of a person\u2019s in-app shopping cart. Then, it conducts thousands of experiments using canned or AI-generated text (powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3) notifications (e.g. \u201cFeeling ravenous?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d \u201cGot a big appetite?\u201d), offering sliding discounts to customers if Aampe\u2019s AI predicts that they\u2019d be more likely to engage within the app.\n\n\u201cAampe operates at the level of the mobile app event-stream or click-stream, which has a common data structure,\u201d Meinshausen said. \u201cEvery app generates a sequence of events that represents each user\u2019s actions \u2014 every swipe and click \u2014 in the app. Aampe\u2019s AI fits that general pattern, and is agnostic to the semantics of each app\u2019s particular business.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

There\u2019s Postscript, which is specifically geared toward Shopify merchants. Mobiz is integrating hyper-personalization into it own brand of mobile marketing. Elsewhere, there\u2019s Marvin, which claims it can improve app engagement by making marketers more timely.\n\nSo what\u2019s Aamp\u2019s secret sauce? The aforementioned experimentation, Meinshausen asserts.\n\nRather than try to predict the future from historical training data, Aampe generates training data by running experiments and then adjusts the messaging dynamically depending on the results of those experiments. This minimizes the need for marketers to set event triggers, figure out when and how often to send messages to users and manually orchestrate messages across channels, Meinshausen says.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that surprises our customers is that our infrastructure is generalizable across so many industries and mobile app use cases,\u201d he added. \u201cAampe is an example of the coming wave of more \u2018agentic\u2019 data layers and software \u2014 infrastructure that makes active decisions rather than simply and naively implementing human-designed rules.\u201d\n\nAampe, which has customers across the U.S., Europe and Asia, including Swiggy and PayU, powers messages that reach over 50 million users each month, according to Meinshausen. In the near term, Aampe intends to focus on hiring, expanding its 15-person team to 20 to 25 by the end of the year."}
