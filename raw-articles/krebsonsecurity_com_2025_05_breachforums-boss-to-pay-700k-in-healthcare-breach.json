Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, a.k.a. \u201cPompompurin,\u201d is slated for resentencing next month after pleading guilty to access device fraud and possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\n\nOn January 18, 2023, denizens of Breachforums posted for sale tens of thousands of records \u2014 including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, and phone numbers \u2014 stolen from Nonstop Health, an insurance provider based in Concord, Calif.\n\nClass-action attorneys sued Nonstop Health, which added Fitzpatrick as a third-party defendant to the civil litigation in November 2023, several months after he was arrested by the FBI and criminally charged with access device fraud and CSAM possession. In January 2025, Nonstop agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle the class action.\n\nJill Fertel is a former prosecutor who runs the cyber litigation practice at Cipriani & Werner, the law firm that represented Nonstop Health. Fertel told KrebsOnSecurity this is the first and only case where a cybercriminal or anyone related to the security incident was actually named in civil litigation.\n\n\u201cCivil plaintiffs are not at all likely to see money seized from threat actors involved in the incident to be made available to people impacted by the breach,\u201d Fertel said. \u201cThe best we could do was make this money available to the class, but it\u2019s still incumbent on the members of the class who are impacted to make that claim.\u201d\n\nMark Rasch is a former federal prosecutor who now represents Unit 221B, a cybersecurity firm based in New York City. Rasch said he doesn\u2019t doubt that the civil settlement involving Fitzpatrick\u2019s criminal activity is a novel legal development.\n\n\u201cIt is rare in these civil cases that you know the threat actor involved in the breach, and it\u2019s also rare that you catch them with sufficient resources to be able to pay a claim,\u201d Rasch said.\n\nDespite admitting to possessing more than 600 CSAM images and personally operating Breachforums, Fitzpatrick was sentenced in January 2024 to time served and 20 years of supervised release. Federal prosecutors objected, arguing that his punishment failed to adequately reflect the seriousness of his crimes or serve as a deterrent.\n\nIndeed, the same month he was sentenced Fitzpatrick was rearrested (PDF) for violating the terms of his release, which forbade him from using a computer that didn\u2019t have court-required monitoring software installed.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Fitzpatrick went on Discord following his guilty plea and professed innocence to the very crimes to which he\u2019d pleaded guilty, stating that his plea deal was \u201cso BS\u201d and that he had \u201cwanted to fight it.\u201d The feds said Fitzpatrick also joked with his friends about selling data to foreign governments, exhorting one user to \u201cbecome a foreign asset to china or russia,\u201d and to \u201csell government secrets.\u201d\n\nIn January 2025, a federal appeals court agreed with the government\u2019s assessment, vacating Fitzpatrick\u2019s sentence and ordering him to be resentenced on June 3, 2025.\n\nFitzpatrick launched BreachForums in March 2022 to replace RaidForums, a similarly popular crime forum that was infiltrated and shut down by the FBI the previous month. As administrator, his alter ego Pompompurin served as the middleman, personally reviewing all databases for sale on the forum and offering an escrow service to those interested in buying stolen data.\n\nThe new site quickly attracted more than 300,000 users, and facilitated the sale of databases stolen from hundreds of hacking victims, including some of the largest consumer data breaches in recent history. In May 2024, a reincarnation of Breachforums was seized by the FBI and international partners. Still more relaunches of the forum occurred after that, with the most recent disruption last month.\n\nAs KrebsOnSecurity reported last year in The Dark Nexus Between Harm Groups and The Com, it is increasingly common for federal investigators to find CSAM material when searching devices seized from cybercriminal suspects. While the mere possession of CSAM is a serious federal crime, not all of those caught with CSAM are necessarily creators or distributors of it. Fertel said some cybercriminal communities have been known to require new entrants to share CSAM material as a way of proving that they are not a federal investigator.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to the darkest corners of Internet, that\u2019s how you prove you\u2019re not law enforcement,\u201d Fertel said. \u201cLaw enforcement would never share that material. It would be criminal for me as a prosecutor, if I obtained and possessed those types of images.\u201d\n\nFurther reading: The settlement between Fitzpatrick and Nonstop (PDF)."}
