Another application by Tesla to trademark the term \u201cRobotaxi\u201d for its upcoming ride-hailing service is still under examination by the office.\n\nIn addition, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term \u201cCybercab\u201d have been halted due to other companies pursuing similar \u201cCyber\u201d trademarks. That includes one company that has applied for numerous trademarks related to aftermarket Cybertruck accessories.\n\nThe USPTO issued Tuesday what\u2019s known as a \u201cnonfinal office action\u201d on the \u201cRobotaxi\u201d trademark application, which means Tesla has three months to file a response or the office will abandon the application. A trademark lawyer representing Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla applied for the trademarks in October 2024 on the same day that it revealed the Cybercab, the purpose-built electric car that it hopes to one day use in its planned autonomous ride-hailing service. Tesla also submitted two similar trademark applications October 10 for the term \u201cRobobus,\u201d which are still under examination.\n\nThe trademark that was refused was assigned to a USPTO examiner on April 14. Tesla said it would use the word in reference to \u201c[l]and vehicles; electric vehicles, namely automobiles; automobiles; and structural parts therefor,\u201d according to the original application.\n\nWhile the USPTO examiner found there were no conflicting trademarks in existence, it refused the application because it was \u201cmerely descriptive.\u201d The examiner wrote that the term \u201cRobotaxi\u201d is \u201cused to describe similar goods and services by other companies.\u201d\n\n\u201c[S]uch wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant\u2019s goods and/or services,\u201d the examiner wrote.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

If it does, the USPTO wants Tesla to provide \u201c[f]act sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent screenshots of applicant\u2019s website as it relates to the goods and/or services in the application, including any materials using the terms in the applied-for mark.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn other words, Tesla needs to give the agency specific plans for how and why it deserves the \u201cRobotaxi\u201d trademark.\n\nThe examiner also wrote that Tesla will need to tell the USPTO if \u201ccompetitors\u201d use the terms \u201cROBO, ROBOT, or ROBOTIC to advertise similar goods and/or services.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s other application for the \u201cRobotaxi\u201d trademark would cover the use of the word when offering transportation services, including \u201ccoordinating travel arrangements for individuals and for groups,\u201d \u201carranging time-based ridesharing services,\u201d and offering vehicle sharing or rentals. That application was also assigned to a USPTO examiner on April 14, but no decision has been filed.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information about the \u201cCybercab\u201d trademark applications."}
