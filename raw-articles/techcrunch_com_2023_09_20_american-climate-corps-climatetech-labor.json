Back then, the program hired millions to plant trees, build bridges, and construct campgrounds. The new one borrows some of those goals and adds new ones, mostly focused on energy efficiency and electrification.\n\n\u201cThe American Climate Corps will mobilize a new, diverse generation of more than 20,000 Americans \u2014 putting them to work conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy, implementing energy efficient technologies, and advancing environmental justice,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\n\nStartups need electricians, too\n\nThe program comes at a time when startups have been lamenting a shortage of skilled labor. The day before the American Climate Corps was announced, three founders onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt said that the labor shortfall is one of the biggest challenges facing their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw this coming a while ago,\u201d said Angelo Campus, co-founder and CEO of BoxPower. \u201cThere\u2019s such a shortage of certified field electricians and union electricians that it was part of the decision for us to productize and prefabricate microgrids because it reduces the need for electricians in the field.\u201d\n\nOne way companies have sought to improve predictability in their operations is by hiring electricians directly rather than relying on contractors, as is often the case in the construction industry. \u201cWe are vertically integrated; we have electricians on staff,\u201d said Kathy Hannun, president of Dandelion, adding that her company is also pursuing productization to speed up installs of their geothermal heat pumps.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The biggest is in New York, where we\u2019ve trained a few thousand people.\u201d\n\nNew corps is a small down payment\n\nThe 20,000 positions created by the American Climate Corps will make for a decent start, but it\u2019s a far cry from the 300,000 the Biden administration originally proposed in its Build Back Better plan. While parts of that plan were implemented in the subsequent Inflation Reduction Act, the $30 billion program was axed. The new corps draws on existing funding.\n\nThe 20,000-strong American Climate Corps is also a drop in the bucket when compared with the projected volume of jobs set to be created by public and private investments following the Inflation Reduction Act. A study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst predicts that nearly 1 million jobs will be created every year for the next decade as a result of $98 billion of investment.\n\nThat figure might be a gross underestimate given that the bill earmarked $369 billion for climate-related investments and incentives, and private investments could ultimately surpass $3 trillion, according to a Goldman Sachs report.\n\nIs the American Climate Corps enough to make a small dent in that? Not really. But it\u2019s a start, and if it proves popular, it might inspire follow-up programs that could begin to deliver the training that Americans will need to fill the tidal wave of new jobs that\u2019s appearing on the horizon."}
