But this can be a resource-intensive endeavor, particularly with issues relating to latency (the time it takes to constantly send data) and the costs associated with this.\n\nSwiss startup LocalStack has set out to address this by shifting the development process off the cloud and onto a developer\u2019s local machine (i.e. their laptop), emulating the environment where it will go live. For now, its focus lies on AWS cloud apps, but the company is looking to ramp things up and go multi-cloud.\n\nTo back that strategy, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $25 million in a Series A round led by Notable Capital, one of the two entities that branched out of GGV Capital earlier this year.\n\nFor context, LocalStack started as an open source project while founder and co-CEO Waldemar Hummer (pictured above right, with co-founder Gerta Sheganaku, and Notable Capital managing partner Glenn Solomon) was at Atlassian in 2017. Initially, they were trying to help one of their Atlassian colleagues work while traveling into the office.\n\n\u201cWe had a team member who was commuting on the train to work, and we wanted to get her productive even while being offline on the train,\u201d Hummer told TechCrunch.\n\nThe idea germinated as a side project in the intervening years, with Hummer teaming up with Gerta Sheganaku, whom he\u2019d known since his time at the University of Technology in Vienna in 2013, to drive early community adoption for the open source project. They launched as a full-time business in 2021, and after raising a small seed round, were later joined by a third co-founder, Thomas Rausch, who\u2019s now head of engineering at the startup.\n\n\u201cWhat first got me excited about LocalStack was the increased adoption in the community, especially after LocalStack was publicly endorsed by Jeff Barr (AWS chief evangelist) \u2014 the GitHub Stars on the project saw a dramatic jump overnight and has been increasing ever since,\u201d Sheganaku said. \u201cBy interacting with the community, we learned that some of the users were working in some of the largest companies of the world, trying to deploy LocalStack not only on their local machines, but also in their CI [continuous integration] pipelines.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

LocalStack also works directly with some customers through an official procurement and onboarding process.\n\nLocalStack.

And the second part is a cloud platform, which serves access to additional features such as team collaboration, telemetry data, insights, and more.\n\nThe company has also retained some of its open source roots with a community version, making around one-third of its AWS services available through a public repository on GitHub. The additional two-thirds are held behind a private repository for paying customers. This community version serves as a useful tool for onboarding paying customers in the future, though that isn\u2019t always the case.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, community users sign up to LocalStack but do not become paying customers,\u201d Sheganaku said. \u201cWe see many thousands of community users who have signed up for our web app, but not purchase any of the paid services.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that developers are already able to \u201cmock out\u201d certain parts of their infrastructure locally to run tests. There\u2019s also popular frameworks like Testcontainers that can be used to simulate certain cloud services and infrastructure components on a local machine, though that usually has a different look, feel and \u201cexperience\u201d to the actual cloud environment.\n\nAWS itself also offers some tools to enable developers to emulate some of its services locally, such as AWS SAM, which supports the likes of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and a few others. But LocalStack\u2019s selling point is that it supports more than 100 core AWS services, including identity and access management (IAM) via Amazon Cognito, Amazon Kinesis data streams, and Amazon\u2019s interactive query service Athena.\n\n\u201cLocalStack is almost like a drop-in replacement for AWS cloud,\u201d Hummer said. \u201cAWS SAM is really more specific to a certain set of services; LocalStack is much more comprehensive.\u201d\n\nThe LocalStack team.

Although it has operated largely under the radar, Hummer says it already has \u201csubstantial revenue numbers\u201d and a global team of more than 50 operating mostly out of Europe. However, its customer base is substantively in the U.S., where it will now be looking to ramp things up in terms of product and go-to-market strategy \u2014 the fresh Series A round will help fund that effort.\n\nFor now, LocalStack\u2019s core focus is AWS, though the company is also working on adding support for Snowflake, which is a different domain from that of AWS, but has similar challenges as it relates to cloud software development. Snowflake support remains in early-stage \u201cpreview\u201d for now, but with the new $25 million in the bank, LocalStack is also gearing up to go multi-cloud, expanding support to Microsoft\u2019s Azure, which Hummer said he hoped would be available some time in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of requests for Azure,\u201d Hummer said.\n\nIn addition to lead backer Notable Capital, LocalStack\u2019s Series A round included participation from existing investors CRV and Heavybit."}
