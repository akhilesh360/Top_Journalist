This time, however, Bosch Ventures plans to put more of its money into North American startups.\n\nLaunched in 2007, Bosch Ventures is now on its sixth fund. And while the corporate VC is technically a global firm, its focus today is weighted more heavily toward North America.\n\nThe strategy may seem contradictory given this is a region affected by a U.S. administration policy that has led to a U.S. trade war with China, a volatile stock market, and fears of a recession. But Bosch Ventures\u2019 managing director, Ingo Ramesohl, told TechCrunch the deal flow in North America is stronger than ever.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of positive energy,\u201d Ramesohl said. \u201cPeople are not stopping to innovate and not stopping to disrupt. So for me, it\u2019s really a great time for new investments.\u201d\n\nThe firm, which has offices in Silicon Valley, Boston, Germany, Tel Aviv, and China, typically makes investments between $5 million and $10 million. Ramesohl said the firm will likely make 20 to 25 investments from this fund.\n\n\u201cThis is basically a continuation of the success stories of the last funds,\u201d Ramesohl said, when asked which tech sectors he is most interested in.\n\nThe firm is still investing in automotive, climate tech, cybersecurity, semiconductor manufacturing, energy efficiency, and enterprise software. Generative AI, more specifically, applying AI tools to the physical world like manufacturing, is also high on the list.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company has said \u2014 and Ramesohl confirmed \u2014 that all Bosch products are now developed or produced using AI, a milestone it hit at the end of 2023.\n\n\u201cGenAI is changing a lot, and at the same time, it\u2019s enabling a lot of new businesses, a lot of new innovations,\u201d he said, noting that, in his view, the most promising applications of AI are in operations."}
