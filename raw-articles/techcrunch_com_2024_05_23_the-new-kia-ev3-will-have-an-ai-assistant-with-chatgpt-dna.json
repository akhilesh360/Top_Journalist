The Kia EV3, and its AI assistant, will first come to market in Korea in July 2024, followed by Europe in the second half of the year. Kia expects to expand sales of the vehicle into other regions following the European launch. It will eventually come to the United States, although the automaker did not provide a date.\n\nThis isn\u2019t, however, a pure OpenAI affair. Kia had its hands in the development of the voice assistant too.\n\nPablo Martinez, Kia\u2019s head of customer experience design, explained that while the large language model (LLM) behind the AI assistant is ChatGPT, it has been \u201cheavily modified\u201d and customized by the automaker. These modifications were made to allow customers to plan trips, control the vehicle and find entertainment, including music or games, all through the new Kia assistant, Martinez said during a media briefing ahead of the reveal.\n\nImage Credits:Kia\n\nVoice assistants in vehicles aren\u2019t new. But the experience for drivers ranges between useless and omg-why-am-I-screaming-at-my-car. Automakers like BMW, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have argued that generative AI will make voice assistants far more capable and give them the ability to engage with drivers and passengers in a natural, conversational way.\n\nChatter about applying generative AI to vehicles ramped up last year as the topic \u2014 and startup OpenAI \u2014 hit the hype stratosphere. Mercedes-Benz added the conversational AI bot to its MBUX infotainment system in June 2023. By January, BMW and Volkswagen were showcasing the technology at the CES tech trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Kia Assistant first debuted in April in the Kia K4, the new gas-powered compact sedan coming to market this summer. The Kia EV3 is the first all-electric vehicle in the company\u2019s portfolio to get the new AI-based assistant."}
