SoundHound \u2014 the voice AI company that provides conversational AI services for automotive, connected home and hospitality applications \u2014 earlier this month laid off 40% of its staff and as a follow up, today announced that it had raised $25 million in equity to shore up its position in the market.\n\nSoundHound did not say who is behind the funding except to note that it is coming from \u201ca diverse set of financial and strategic investors, both from the current shareholder base and new capital providers.\u201d\n\nSoundHound notes that it\u2019s coming in the form of preferred equity and convertible into shares of Class A common stock, potentially \u201con or after the one year anniversary of the issuance date if certain price conditions are met.\u201d We have reached out to the company to see if we can get more detail on that investor list.\n\nWe have also asked if it could provide more specific detail on how the proceeds will be used. One report from last week noted that the laid-off employees will only be getting severance if the company raises more money, and we have confirmed with the company that this will be one of the uses.\n\nSoundHound was once valued at $1 billion+ when still a privately held startup and seen as an independent alternative to services built by Big Tech, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa. (Earlier than that, it developed music AI, and many thought of it as a more powerful and effective alternative to Shazam, the company acquired by Apple that helps with identifying music.)\n\nSoundHound went public in November 2021 by way of a SPAC merger at a $2.1 billion valuation. But \u2026 surprise, surprise, the SPAC valuation went the way of so many other SPACs and did not hold. SoundHound today has a market cap of $295 million.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been helped by the wider economic climate and the winter that has hit the tech sector in particular. Tech stocks have taken a nosedive in the last year, and that\u2019s impacting companies particularly hard when they are still effectively proving out their product-market fit.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But how much all of that has played out in products \u2014 and specifically products that are generating revenue right now \u2014 is not so clear.\n\nThe company, in its funding announcement, also provided a preliminary look at its full-year 2022 results, and they are okay but not massive. Revenues will be $31 million for the year, \u201cat the high end of its prior guidance,\u201d with gross margins of over 70%. \u201cThe Company expects revenue growth in 2023 to accelerate to approximately 50% year over year due to its strong customer base, well over $300 million bookings foundation, and increasing demand for its voice AI-enabled customer service products,\u201d it noted. In other words, it\u2019s continuing to put a lot of hope on future prospects.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this post as we learn more."}
