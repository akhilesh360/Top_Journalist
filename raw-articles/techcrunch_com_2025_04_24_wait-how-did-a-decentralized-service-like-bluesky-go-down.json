According to a message on Bluesky\u2019s status page, the company was aware of the outage, which it attributed to \u201cMajor PDS Networking Problems.\u201d (PDS means personal data servers.)\n\nThe first status message was posted at 6:55 p.m. ET, and a second one indicating that a fix was being applied was shared soon after, at 7:38 p.m. ET.\n\nThe question many may be asking now is, how did this decentralized social network go down? Isn\u2019t it \u2026 decentralized? Isn\u2019t one of the perks of decentralization that there\u2019s not a single point of failure?\n\nDespite the platform\u2019s decentralized nature, the majority of Bluesky users today interact with the service via Bluesky\u2019s official app, powered by the AT Protocol. While in theory, anyone can run the various parts of the infrastructure that make up the protocol, including PDS, relays, and other components, it\u2019s still early days for the social network, so few have done so.\n\nThose who did, however, were not impacted by the outage.\n\nIn time, the idea is that many communities will be built on Bluesky, some with their own infrastructure, moderation services, and even client applications. (One example is the work that the Blacksky team is doing to create safer, more welcoming online spaces that take advantage of these decentralized tools.)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Mastodon users were quick to point to the outage in order to make jokes or jabs that focused on Bluesky\u2019s approach to decentralization.\n\nOne Mastodon user, Luke Johnson, wrote, \u201cSee how the mighty Bluesky crumbles while the Raspberry Pi running Mastodon under my bed just keeps chugging along\u201d \u2014 a reference to how Mastodon can run off even tiny machines users themselves configure.\n\nOr, as another Mastodon user joked, \u201cnice decentralisation ya got there.\u201d\n\nIn any event, Bluesky\u2019s outage was resolved shortly after it began and the service is back up and running.\n\nOn Friday, Bluesky CTO Paul Frazee confirmed in a post that Bluesky\u2019s personal data servers (PDS) were the victim of DDoS attacks \u2014 typically, malicious attempts by bad actors to disrupt normal traffic to a server. Other PDSs were not targeted. The attack\u2019s source has not been identified, but Frazee says the current theory is that it was an accident by a third party.\n\nThis post was updated after publication to include the confirmation of the DDoS attack."}
