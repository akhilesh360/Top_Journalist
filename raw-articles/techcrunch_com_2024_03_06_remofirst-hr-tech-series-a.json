Deel and Rippling are the Goliaths, both having raised millions of dollars in venture capital. But Remofirst, which just secured $25 million in Series A funding, is proving to be a very worthy David.\n\nRemofirst, an HR tech startup, touts that it hires its clients\u2019 employees and contractors in more than 180 countries on their behalf without those companies having to set up local entities. This can save those companies both time and money while also helping them be more compliant, according to CEO and co-founder Nurasyl Serik.\n\nBy serving as an employer of record, Remofirst operates that entity to hire workers on behalf of businesses and handles \u201ceverything to do with hiring a person in a company,\u201d Serik said. That includes managing payroll, taxes, employment, and compliance; providing work equipment; and helping businesses come up with competitive compensation plans and offering health, dental and vision insurance.\n\nRemofirst says that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown 10x since it raised its $14.1 million seed round in September 2022, although it declined to reveal hard revenue figures.\n\nThat revenue growth helped attract three term sheets in four weeks, according to Serik, allowing it to secure $25 million in Series A funding. European VC firm Octopus Ventures led the latest raise, which also included participation from existing backers QED, Mouro Capital and Counterpart Ventures.\n\nThe company declined to reveal valuation, noting only that it was a \u201cstrong up round.\u201d\n\nAlthough it has raised far less capital than competitors Deel (which has raised more than $600 million and was last valued at $12 billion) and Rippling (which raised $500 million in 2023 alone), Remofirst is undeterred and believes it is differentiated in a few ways, one of which is that it is far more affordable, Serik claims.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Today, it has thousands of customers, including Zocdoc, World Health Organization and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cWe see SMBs as an underserved segment of the market,\u201d Serik told TechCrunch.\n\nOctopus Ventures principal Nick Sando told TechCrunch via email that his firm believes that \u201cRemofirst offers an exceptional level of service, at a significantly more affordable price. This means they can serve a broader range of companies than similar offerings.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to use its new capital in part to \u201csignificantly expand\u201d its presence in international markets, such as the United Kingdom.\n\nOn March 4, Deel announced that it is acquiring PaySpace, an African-based payroll and HR software and services company, in a deal that marks its largest acquisition to date. It also announced that it has crossed $500 million in ARR. Also on Tuesday, UAE-based RemotePass announced it had raised $5.5 million in Series A funding led by Istanbul-based 212 VC."}
