Byju\u2019s was planning to go public in early 2022 with several investment bankers giving the firm valuation as high as $50 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier.\n\nHe alleged that many of his more than 100 investors had urged him to pursue aggressive expansion into as many as 40 markets. But, he added, those very investors got cold feet when global markets tumbled following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, sending the venture capital market into a downward spiral.\n\nRaveendran said many of his investors \u201cran away,\u201d and the departure of three key backers \u2014 Prosus Ventures, Peak XV, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative \u2014 from the company\u2019s board last year made it impossible for the startup to raise additional funds.\n\nRepresentatives of the aforementioned three firms as well as auditor Deloitte left the startup\u2019s board last year, citing governance issues.\n\nByju\u2019s has since entered insolvency proceedings, and Raveendran, who no longer controls the company, said: \u201cIt\u2019s worth zero. What valuation are you talking about? It\u2019s worth zero.\u201d\n\nByju\u2019s, once India\u2019s most valuable startup, counts BlackRock, UBS, Lightspeed, QIA, Bond, Silver Lake, Sofina, Verlinvest, Tencent, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Owl Ventures, and World Bank\u2019s IFC among its backers. It has raised more than $5 billion to date.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

I came from a small village. I invested everything I had into the startup.\u201d"}
