Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Wynn-Williams admitted that Meta (which was then known as Facebook) had targeted 13- to 17-year-olds with ads when they were feeling down or depressed.\n\n\u201cIt could identify when they were feeling worthless or helpless or like a failure, and [Meta] would take that information and share it with advertisers,\u201d Wynn-Williams told the senators on the subcommittee for crime and terrorism within the Judiciary Committee. \u201cAdvertisers understand that when people don\u2019t feel good about themselves, it\u2019s often a good time to pitch a product \u2014 people are more likely to buy something.\u201d\n\nShe said the company was letting advertisers know when the teens were depressed so they could be served an ad at the best time. As an example, she suggested that if a teen girl deleted a selfie, advertisers might see that as a good time to sell her a beauty product as she may not be feeling great about her appearance. They also targeted teens with ads for weight loss when young girls had concerns around body confidence, Wynn-Williams said.\n\nShe claimed that Meta was aware that users aged 13-17 were a vulnerable but \u201cvery valuable\u201d demographic to advertisers, which was the motive.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And one document displayed during the hearing showed an example of just that, it turned out.\n\nIn a screenshot of an internal chat, a Facebook policy director asks if it\u2019s true that Facebook was doing research into young mothers and their emotional state, to which another person replied, \u201cyes,\u201d even joking that they may ask their \u201capparently morally bankrupt colleagues\u201d if there was any other research like this.\n\nAdding a bit more color to her comments, Wynn-Williams also noted that it had surprised her how many Silicon Valley executives didn\u2019t let their own children use the products they built.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018Oh has your teen used the new product we\u2019re about to launch?,\u2019\u201d Wynn-Williams said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018My teenagers are not allowed on Facebook. I don\u2019t have my teenager on Instagram.\u2019 These executives \u2026 they know. They know the harm this product does. They don\u2019t allow their own teenagers to use the products that Meta develops. The hypocrisy is at every level.\u201d\n\nIn a company statement, Meta denied the allegations in Wynn-Williams\u2019 testimony, calling them \u201cdivorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\u201d\n\nIn response to the claims about teens, Meta added the following:\n\n\u201cWe know parents are worried about their teens having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online, which is why we\u2019re making significant changes to the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts. These accounts provide teens with built-in protections to automatically limit who\u2019s contacting them and the content they\u2019re seeing, and teens under 16 need a parent\u2019s permission to change those account settings. We\u2019re also giving parents more oversight over their teens\u2019 use of Instagram, with ways to see who their teens are chatting with and block them from using the app beyond 15 minutes per day, or for certain periods of time, like during school or at night.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe company also pointed to a 2017 statement it made that directly responded to the claims about targeting ads at people based on their emotional state, saying that the market analysis was \u201cnever used to target ads and was based on data that was anonymous and aggregated.\u201d\n\nUpdated after publication with additional statements from Meta."}
