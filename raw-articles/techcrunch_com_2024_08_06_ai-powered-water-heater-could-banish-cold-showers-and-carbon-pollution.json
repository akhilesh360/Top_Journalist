It\u2019s a classic case of supply not meeting demand. Michael Rigney thinks he can predict when a household will need more hot water, eliminating cold showers without turning to expensive alternatives like on-demand water heaters.\n\nRigney\u2019s quest started a few years ago when he began researching water heating. What he saw \u201cwas really eye opening,\u201d Rigney told TechCrunch in a recent interview.\n\nThe basic technology behind most water heaters, whether they\u2019re gas or electric, hasn\u2019t changed much in several decades. They might be cheap to buy, but they\u2019re not cheap to run.\n\nHeat pump water heaters have started to change that for many homeowners, improving efficiency and lowering utility bills. But even there, \u201cI saw a tremendous opportunity for improvement,\u201d Rigney said.\n\nHe founded Cala Systems in Boston in 2020 as heat pump water heaters were beginning to take off. Because of that shift, he said, \u201cthere was an entrepreneurial opportunity to build the best heat pump water heater.\u201d\n\nWater heaters tend to be fairly straightforward appliances: At their core, they have three basic parts: an insulated tank, a heating element and a thermostat. Most people set the temperature once and forget it; on rare occasions, they might set it a bit higher when overnight guests arrive. As hot water is drawn from the tank, cold water replaces it, driving down the temperature inside. When the temp gets low enough, the thermostat tells the heater to turn on.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Image Credits:Cala Systems\n\nCala Systems\u2019 water heater pairs an advanced heat pump with an AI-powered control system to forecast hot water demand and heat the water in the tank accordingly. The company gathers general information like weather forecasts and time-of-use energy pricing and sends it to the water heater. That data is then analyzed on the device along with household-specific information, including water usage patterns, incoming cold water temperature and whether the home has solar panels. (Rigney said the company will never sell household data.)\n\nBy analyzing water use patterns, the tank can anticipate when there will be a surge in demand and heat the water in the most efficient way possible.\n\nFor example, if the weather is predicting a handful of sunny days before a couple days of clouds, Cala\u2019s algorithms might decide to use daytime power from a homeowner\u2019s solar panels to overheat the tank. Then, when hot water is called for, it mixes it with cold water to cool down to the appropriate temperature. That allows the water heater to make the most of excess solar production, essentially turning the tank into a battery that stores energy for a cloudy day.\n\nIn other instances, when both weather and water demand are consistent, Cala\u2019s water heater can slow down the speed of the compressor, lengthening the time it takes to heat the tank for an efficiency bump. \u201cIn water heating, when you slow down the compressor, you increase the efficiency of heat transfer by about 30%.\u201d Rigney said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty significant impact.\u201d\n\nAnd if there are house guests coming? Cala included a boost mode that people can activate on the tank or in an app.\n\nToday, water heaters in the U.S. are split almost evenly between natural gas and electric resistance, with oil, propane and heat pumps rounding things out. Water heating is responsible for around 20% of the typical American household\u2019s energy usage, and heat pump water heaters slash that significantly while also cutting people\u2019s dependence on natural gas.\n\nHeat pump water heaters may only make up a few percent of the market, but they are rapidly growing in share, helped in part by incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act. And while they\u2019re more expensive to install up front, they\u2019re cheaper in the long run because they\u2019re more efficient to operate, leading to lower household carbon emissions.\n\nRigney said that Cala will be buying parts from various suppliers and assembling the final product in the U.S. (\u201cThis is not a product that ships well,\u201d he said with a laugh.) The company\u2019s first product, a 65-gallon model, will cost $2,850; it\u2019s available to preorder with delivery sometime early next year. That\u2019s about $800 more than competitors, though Rigney said that lower utility bills should eliminate that difference over time.\n\nTo support the rollout, Cala exclusively told TechCrunch that it has raised a $5.6 million seed round led by the Clean Energy Venture Group and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, with Burnt Island Ventures, CapeVista Capital and Leap Forward Ventures participating. With so few heat pump water heaters sold to date, \u201cthis is a category that is truly nascent,\u201d Rigney said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s an opportunity here to redefine what people expect a water heater to do.\u201d"}
