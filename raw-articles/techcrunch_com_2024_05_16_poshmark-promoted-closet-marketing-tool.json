Sellers can set a weekly budget they want to pay and only get charged when a shopper selects the promoted listing. There\u2019s an option to set the budget manually or to get a recommendation from Poshmark, which looks at the size of the closet, the type of listings and the value of brands featured to determine the demand and competition for those items.\n\nThere\u2019s also an analytics dashboard where sellers can see the number of impressions, clicks, sales, return on ad spend, cost per click and clickthrough rate. The company recently expanded the amount of historical data, up from 30 days, so sellers can now view a year\u2019s worth of sold listing data.\n\nImage Credits:Poshmark\n\nPoshmark\u2019s new feature has been in beta with tens of thousands of sellers since early 2023 and has helped testers see a 43% increase in sales, according to the company. Starting today, it\u2019s officially available for all users in the U.S. on both desktop and mobile. For a limited time, Poshmark is offering a seven-day free trial.\n\nPoshmark didn\u2019t say when the feature will roll out to Canada, which is the only other market where the platform is available. (It used to exist in other markets, but the company shut down its international business in October.)\n\nImage Credits:Poshmark\n\nSince being acquired by Naver last year, Poshmark has made several enhancements to its resale marketplace. For instance, \u201cPosh Shows,\u201d a feature for hosting live auctions, and \u201cShare Shows,\u201d where users collaborate with other sellers to bring their audiences together. There\u2019s also \u201cPosh Lens,\u201d an AI-powered visual search tool where buyers can take a picture of a specific item and find relevant listings.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
