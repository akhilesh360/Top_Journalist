As such, the company has access to massive amounts of health information on about a third of all Americans.\n\nThe cyberattack prompted the company to shut down its systems, resulting in outages and delays to thousands of healthcare providers who rely on Change, and affecting countless patients who could not obtain prescriptions or had medical care or procedures delayed.\n\nChange said in its latest statement that it \u201ccannot confirm exactly\u201d what data was stolen about each individual, and that the information may vary from person to person.\n\nThe affected information includes personal information, such as names and addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, as well as government identity documents, such as Social Security numbers, driver licenses and passport numbers.\n\nThe data also includes medical records and health information, such as diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging and care and treatment plans, said Change. The hackers stole health insurance information, including plan and policy details, as well as billing, claims and payment information, which Change said includes financial and banking information.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Some of the stolen information may relate to guarantors who paid healthcare bills for someone else, the company said.\n\nThe company added that affected individuals should receive notice by mail beginning late July.\n\nThe ransomware attack on Change Healthcare stands as one of the largest-ever known digital thefts of U.S. medical records. While the full impact of this data breach remains unclear, the ramifications for the millions of Americans whose private medical information was irretrievably compromised are likely incalculable.\n\nChange said it secured a copy of the stolen dataset in March to review for identifying and notifying affected individuals, which TechCrunch previously reported was obtained in exchange for paying a ransom demand.\n\nUnitedHealth confirmed it paid at least one ransom demand to the cybercriminal group behind the ransomware attack, known as ALPHV, in an effort to prevent the publication of the stolen files. Another hacking group called RansomHub demanded an additional payment from UnitedHealth after claiming ALPHV made off with the first ransom payment but left the stolen data with one of its affiliates \u2014 essentially a contractor \u2014 who broke in and deployed the ransomware on Change\u2019s systems.\n\nRansomHub subsequently published several files on its dark web leak site and threatened to sell the data to the highest bidder if another ransom wasn\u2019t paid.\n\nAccording to UnitedHealth chief executive Andrew Witty, the hackers broke into Change Healthcare\u2019s network using a set of stolen credentials to an internal system that was not protected with multi-factor authentication, a security feature that makes it more difficult for malicious hackers to misuse stolen passwords.\n\nThe ransomware attack cost UnitedHealth around $870 million in the first three months of the year, during which the company made $100 billion in revenue, according to the company\u2019s earnings report. UnitedHealth is expected to report its most recent earnings in mid-July."}
