The elements, including neodymium, praseodymium, and cerium, themselves aren\u2019t rare. But they\u2019re concentrated in certain parts of the globe and are very challenging to refine into anything useful. Their unique electric and magnetic properties make them essential for electronics like hard drives and headphones, and some are used as contrast agents for MRI and CT scans. Many sell for tens of thousands of dollars per metric ton.\n\nIn recent years, China has become the dominant refiner of rare earths, and the Chinese Communist Party uses them as bargaining chips in tit-for-tat trade disputes with the U.S.\n\n\u201cTypically, there\u2019s 330,000 to 350,000 tons of rare earths produced per year. Historically, almost none of them are produced in the U.S.,\u201d said Nathan Ratledge, co-founder and CEO of Alta Resource Technologies.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is nervous enough that it has made securing the elements a key part of its industrial strategy.\n\n\u201cChina can very easily weaponize this critical mineral supply,\u201d Ratledge said. The potential fallout extends beyond defense applications, too. \u201cThey\u2019ve already put export restrictions on some stuff that\u2019s pretty critical to a lot of real valuable companies like Nvidia and Apple.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. currently has one operating rare earth mine in California, but it has had a rocky history. Ratledge said there\u2019s an alternative, though, lurking in the tons of e-waste the country generates every year.\n\nAlta claims it has developed a way to extract rare earth elements from low-grade supplies more efficiently than current refining techniques, which tend to rely on toxic chemicals applied over dozens of steps. The company, which until now has operated in stealth, instead uses a series of proteins that are specially designed to latch onto rare earth elements, whether they\u2019re from virgin ore or electronic waste.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And when things are more complex, biology tends to shine because of the selectivity. The trick is harnessing biology in the right way.\u201d\n\nAlta\u2019s proteins are attached to a resin and loaded into a column through which solutions containing rare earth elements are allowed to percolate. The proteins snatch rare earths out of solution and, when they\u2019re saturated, the column is flushed and washed to release the metals. Ratledge said the proteins have proven to be surprisingly durable.\n\nThe company is planning to build a pilot-scale plant this year that\u2019s about the size of a shipping container. Ratledge said that Alta \u201chas reasonable conviction\u201d that the federal government will help fund at least part of the cost of the pilot.\n\nTo help with refining the technology and scaling it up, Alta has raised a $5.1 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by DCVC and Voyager Ventures with participation from Orion Industrial Ventures, Overture, and WovenEarth Ventures. The startup has also secured about $1 million in grant funding from DARPA and the state of Colorado.\n\nThough Alta won\u2019t be able to shift rare earth refining back to the U.S. overnight, Ratledge is optimistic that his company can produce enough metal to help the Pentagon breathe easier.\n\n\u201cTo de-risk some of the core national security concerns, you don\u2019t need hundreds of thousands of tons. You\u2019re talking single-digit-thousands of tons. Being able to meet those needs for the U.S. government is a near-term opportunity for us and other people like us,\u201d he said."}
