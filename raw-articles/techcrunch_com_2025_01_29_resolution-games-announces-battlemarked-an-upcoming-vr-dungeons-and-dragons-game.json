However, on Wednesday, the companies finally unveiled the official title and more information, bringing players one step closer to experiencing a VR D&D experience.\n\nThe upcoming game, titled Battlemarked, leverages Resolution Games\u2019 Demeo system, which emphasizes a virtual tabletop environment and features gameplay similar to D&D with turn-based combat. Demeo also incorporates an action point system that uses playing cards.\n\nNotably, Battlemarked is the first partnership between Resolution Games and Wizards of the Coast, so it\u2019s expected to feel more like an official D&D experience than Demeo. However, unlike the real thing, Battlemarked doesn\u2019t require a Dungeon Master (DM). Instead, Resolution Games intends for players to concentrate more on strategy and decision-making rather than roleplaying.\n\nAt launch, Battlemarked will have two story-driven campaigns that up to four players can enjoy.\n\nThe game will be available on various platforms, including VR, PC, and console. Although the company did not provide a specific list of supported devices, we do know that Demeo is available on Meta Quest, Pico, SteamVR, PlayStation VR2, PlayStation 5, PC, Mac, and iPad. Battlemarked may launch on these same devices as well.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The details of the campaigns remain unknown as well. Resolution Games has stated that they plan to introduce additional campaigns set in \u201cdifferent D&D settings\u201d in the future. The company declined to answer our questions.\n\nResolution Games is a decade-old gaming studio based in Stockholm, Sweden. It has a wide range of games, including Angry Birds: Isle of Pigs, Cook-Out: A Sandwich Tale, and Spatial Ops, among others. The company has raised around $38.6 million to date, according to PitchBook.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement reflects the ongoing trend of D&D gaining mainstream popularity. It has evolved into a multi-media franchise, including popular web series such as Critical Role and Dimension 20, video games like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 from Larian Studios, as well as the theatrical release, \u201cHonor Among Thieves.\u201d"}
