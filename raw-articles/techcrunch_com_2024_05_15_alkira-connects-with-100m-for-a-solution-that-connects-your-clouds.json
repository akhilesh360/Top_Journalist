Other new investors, NextEquity Partners and Geodesic Capital, as well as previous backers Dallas Venture Capital, Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and KDT (Koch Disruptive Technologies) also participated in the round.\n\nAlkira\u2019s CEO, Amir Khan, did not disclose the startup\u2019s valuation, but said that it\u2019s \u201ccertainly an up-round.\u201d PitchBook estimates that Alkira was last valued at $234 million, although that dates from a funding round back in 2020, and the company has grown since then. Its customers come from a range of verticals like industry (Koch is a strategic investor in the firm), financial services (S&P) and media (Warner Music), and the company has raised $176 million to date.\n\nAlkira is addressing one of the thornier aspects of the cloud revolution. Customers typically adopt a hybrid approach to cloud networking to hedge their bets, get the most competitive pricing by region, and lean into flexible arrangements, using multiple vendors, and in many cases, running private, public and on-premises servers in tandem depending on their needs.\n\nThe problem with that, though, is that buying, implementing and managing that plate of spaghetti can prove to be an indigestible nightmare. The spike in the popularity of AI-based applications, which might require even more compute and resources, is certainly exacerbating this issue, but this is a problem that has persisted for years and will continue to, regardless of whether AI is here to stay.\n\nAs Khan described it to me, with Alkira, end-users can negotiate and manage their own compute deals, but they can hand over the designing of those deals to Alkira. The company essentially integrates all those disparate services behind the scenes so that they can be managed and viewed as a single service \u2014 kind of orchestrating and virtualizing an organization\u2019s infrastructure on a grand scale. Alkira can support integration with all major cloud providers, Khan told me.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The two have years of experience working in the world of telecoms \u2014 a wonderful training ground, it turns out, for the incredible fragmentation of today\u2019s cloud computing landscape. (\u201cAlkira\u201d is an Aboriginal word roughly meaning \u201cbright, blue sky,\u201d a reference to clearing up the darkness of today\u2019s \u201cclouds.\u201d)\n\nThey previously founded another startup that was closer to that legacy networking space: Viptela, which specializes in software-defined wide area networking, and was acquired by Cisco for $610 million in 2017.\n\nThis new turn into cloud computing puts Alkira up against a completely different wave of would-be competitors, though the very biggest players, like AWS, Azure and Google, are yet to make significant progress in working together. That leaves a wide opening for third-party players to do the stitching and virtualizing for them.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see Tiger Global leading this round. The firm is still investing, although as you can see by the table below that its activity has really dropped off a cliff in the last two years. That context makes this deal all the more significant.\n\nTiger\u2019s investments by year.
