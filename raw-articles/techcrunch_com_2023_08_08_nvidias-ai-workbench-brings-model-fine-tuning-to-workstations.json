Using it, developers can fine-tune and test models from popular repositories like Hugging Face and GitHub using proprietary data, and they can access cloud computing resources when the need to scale arises.\n\nManuvir Das, VP of enterprise computing at Nvidia, says that the impetus for AI Workbench was the challenge \u2014 and time-consuming nature \u2014 of customizing large AI models. Enterprise-scale AI projects can require hunting through multiple repositories for the right framework and tools, a process further complicated when projects have to be moved from one infrastructure to another.\n\nCertainly, the success rate for launching enterprise models into production is low. According to a poll from KDnuggets, the data science and business analytics platform, the majority of data scientists responding say that 80% or more of their projects stall before deploying a machine learning model. A separate estimate from Gartner suggests that close to 85% of big data projects fail, due in part to infrastructural roadblocks.\n\n\u201cEnterprises around the world are racing to find the right infrastructure and build generative AI models and applications,\u201d Das said in a canned statement. \u201cNvidia AI Workbench provides a simplified path for cross-organizational teams to create the AI-based applications that are increasingly becoming essential in modern business.\u201d\n\nThe jury\u2019s out on just how \u201csimplified\u201d the path is. But to Das\u2019 point, AI Workbench allows developers to pull together models, frameworks, SDKs and libraries, including libraries for data prep and data visualization, from open source resources into a unified workspace.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAs the demand for AI \u2014 particularly generative AI \u2014 grows, there\u2019s been an influx of tools focused on fine-tuning large, general models to specific use cases. Startups like Fixie, Reka and Together aim to make it easier for companies and individual developers to customize models to their needs without having to shell out for costly cloud compute.\n\nWith AI workbench, Nvidia\u2019s pitching a more decentralized approach to fine-tuning \u2014 one that happens on a local machine as opposed to a cloud service. That makes sense, given Nvidia and its product portfolio of AI-accelerating GPUs stand to benefit; Nvidia makes not-so-subtle mentions of its RTX lineup in the press release announcing the news. But Nvidia\u2019s commercial motivations aside, the pitch might appeal to developers who don\u2019t wish to be beholden to a single cloud or service for AI model experimentation.\n\nAI-driven demand for GPUs has propelled Nvidia\u2019s earnings to new heights. In May, the company\u2019s market cap briefly reached $1 trillion after Nvidia reported $7.19 billion in revenue, up 19% from the previous fiscal quarter."}
