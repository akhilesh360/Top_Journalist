TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.\n\nNonetheless, TikTok\u2019s future remains uncertain, and a potential second ban on April 5 is looming. A number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app, and if a deal were to go through, the platform\u2019s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research\u2019s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.\n\nTikTok ban: What\u2019s happened so far\n\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we\u2019ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok\u2019s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\n\nThe drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\n\nA month later, Trump\u2019s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\n\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives, in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok. On April 23, 2024, the Senate passed the bill.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\n\nTrump has a change of heart\n\nOn December 27, 2024, Trump opposed the potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as \u201cthe TikTok ban.\u201d TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19.\n\nTikTok shuts down \u2026 then comes back online\n\nAlthough TikTok indeed shut itself down in the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn\u2019t last long. The app came back online less than 12 hours later. The platform noted, \u201cAs a result of President Trump\u2019s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.\u201d\n\nWhere we are today\n\nOn January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\n\nIn early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups that are interested in buying the platform, per Reuters. More recently, The Information reported that Trump intends to announce TikTok America, a company backed by American investors that owns around 50% of U.S. operations. ByteDance would reportedly own 19.9%.\n\nAs of now, no definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon.\n\nBelow is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly, Elon Musk is not among them.)\n\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok\n\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok is a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
