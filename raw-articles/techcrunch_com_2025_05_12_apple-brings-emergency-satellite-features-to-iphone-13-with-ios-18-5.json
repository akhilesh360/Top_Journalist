Previously, the satellite features were available to those running an iPhone 14 or later.\n\nThe emergency satellite system for iPhone is designed to be used at critical times when a cellular signal or Wi-Fi is not available, as it lets people contact emergency services, send a text by satellite, share information with their emergency contacts, or call for roadside assistance. To date, the feature has been credited with saving lives, rescuers say, including helping lost and injured hikers, saving people from wildfires, and more.\n\nCarrier-provided satellite features don\u2019t have to be used for emergencies, though they often are. You could also text a friend via satellite, if you chose or use whichever other features the carriers offer.\n\nThe iOS 18.5 update is focused on providing access to carriers\u2019 satellite services, like those from T-Mobile (with Starlink). You can check to see if you have access to this feature from the Cellular menu under the iPhone\u2019s Settings.\n\nWhile the expansion of satellite services to iPhone 13 owners is the most notable addition with iOS 18.5, iPhone users are also receiving a good handful of smaller updates.\n\nThis includes the addition of a new feature for Screen Time, Apple\u2019s parental control software, which alerts parents if their child correctly enters the parent\u2019s passcode to access Screen Time permissions.\n\nAmong the other improvements is an updated Mail app, which makes it easier to access the \u201cAll Mail\u201d category as its own tab; a new Pride wallpaper; and an easier way to subscribe to content from the Apple TV app on a smart TV or connected device. Plus, Apple has fixed a bug where the Apple Vision Pro app would launch with a black screen if downloaded from the App Store, as well as other bugs with Siri, enterprise apps not launching, and more.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
