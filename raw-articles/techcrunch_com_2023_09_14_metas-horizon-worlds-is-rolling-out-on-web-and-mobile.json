The VR social app has started rolling out for some users on web and mobile in early access, Meta said.\n\nBy expanding to mobile and web, Horizon Worlds can cater to a much larger user base, instead of only users with a Quest VR headset. But if the platform isn\u2019t enjoyable, it won\u2019t matter how many devices it can be played on.\n\nMeta has never released any user numbers for the VR version of Horizon Worlds, but reports have shown that the platform is not very populated.\n\nIn the game, players embody their virtual avatar and can play games and hang out in \u201cworlds,\u201d which are made either by Meta or from users themselves. Users can also create items to sell, but Meta takes a 47.5% cut of sales.\n\nEarlier this year, Horizon Worlds opened to teenage users, a decision that Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Ed Markey (D-MA) decried. Teenage users automatically are set to the \u201cgarbled voices\u201d setting, which changes the voices of people a teen doesn\u2019t know into gibberish.\n\nMost importantly, yes, Meta is working on giving avatars legs."}
