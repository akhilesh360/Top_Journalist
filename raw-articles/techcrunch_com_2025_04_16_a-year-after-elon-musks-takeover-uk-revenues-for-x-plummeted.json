Profit dropped to \u00a31.2 million ($1.6 million) from \u00a35.6 million ($7.4 million) in the same period.\n\nThe company said it \u201ccontinues to take corrective measures to build brand safety tools, invest in platform safety and content moderation, and then educate advertisers about these initiatives,\u201d per the report.\n\nMusk\u2019s arrival also led to a wave of redundancies in the U.K. office, mirroring his cuts to U.S.-based staff. Employee numbers in the U.K. fell to 114 in 2023 from 399 the previous year."}
