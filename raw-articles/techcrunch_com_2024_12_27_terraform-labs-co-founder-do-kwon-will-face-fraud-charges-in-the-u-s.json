Terraform agreed to pay $4.5 billion to settle the case with the SEC.\n\nKwon was arrested in March 2023 at the airport in Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital, while preparing to board a flight to Dubai. It\u2019s unclear when Montenegro plans on releasing Kwon to the U.S. and whether the government\u2019s latest decision supersedes its order in August to extradite Kwon to South Korea."}
