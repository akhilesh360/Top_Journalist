He spoke about tech platforms having become more powerful than governments; that these social media spaces were created based on community, yet said there has been \u201cno responsibility to ensure the safety of those online communities.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he said that there were people in power only incentivized by pure profit, rather than safety and well-being. \u201cYou have the knowledge and the skillset and the confidence and the bravery and the courage to be able to stand up to these things,\u201d he said to the crowd.\n\nThe event yesterday was hosted by the Responsible Tech Youth Power Fund (RTYPF), a grant initiative to support youth organizations working to shape the future of technology. The duke\u2019s foundation, Archewell, which he co-founded with his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, funded the second cohort of RTYPF grantees, alongside names like Pinterest and Melinda French Gates\u2019 Pivotal Ventures.\n\nTechCrunch received exclusive access to the event to chat with attendees, average age of around 22, about their work amidst the rapidly changing technological landscape.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Everything is moving so fast these days, they said, faster than the law can keep up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the youth are anti-technology,\u201d said Lydia Burns, 27, who leads youth and community partnerships at the nonprofit Seek Common Ground. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we feel we should have more input and seats at the table to talk about how these things impact our lives.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry meeting with participants at the RTYPF Image Credits:Emil Cohen for Archewell\n\nYoung people are increasingly worried about social media\n\nEach turn of every conversation at the event led back to social media.\n\nIt\u2019s consuming every part of a young person\u2019s life, yet the clouds have the potential to become darker, the young people said at the event.\n\nAdam Billen, 23, helps run the organization Encode, which advocates for safe and responsible AI. He\u2019s worked on the Take It Down Act, seeking to tackle AI-generated porn and other pieces of legislation, like California\u2019s SB 53 that wants to establish whistleblower protections for employees over AI-related issues. Billen, like the other young people at the event, is working fast to help the people in power understand new technology that is innovating even faster.\n\n\u201cAs recently as two years ago, it was just not possible for someone without technical expertise to create realistic AI nudes of someone,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cBut today, with advances in generative AI, there are apps and websites publicly available for free that are being advertised to kids,\u201d on social media platforms.\n\nHe\u2019s heard of cases where young people simply take photos of their classmates, fully clothed, and then upload them to AI image platforms to get realistic nudes of their peers. Doing that is not nationally illegal yet, he said, and guardrails from Big Tech are loose. On these platforms, he said, it\u2019s all too easy to see advertisements for tools to create deepfake porn, meaning it\u2019s all too easy for children to find it too.\n\nSneha Dave, 26, the founder of Generation Patient, an organization that advocates for the support of young people with chronic conditions, is also worried about the sharp turn social media has taken. Influencers are doing paid advertisements for prescription medications, and teenagers are being fed pharmaceutical ads on social media, she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how the FDA works with these companies to try to flag to make sure there\u2019s not misinformation being spread by influencers advertising these prescription medications,\u201d Dave told TechCrunch, speaking about Big Tech platforms.\n\nSocial media in general has become a mental health crisis, the young people told us. Yoelle Gulko, 22, is working on a film to help people better understand the dangers of social media. She said walking through college campuses these days, she hears of numerous people simply deleting their social media accounts, feeling helpless in their relationship to the online world.\n\n\u201cYoung people shouldn\u2019t be left to fend for themselves,\u201d Gulko said. \u201cYoung people should really be given the tools to succeed online, and that\u2019s something a lot of us are doing.\u201d\n\nAdam Billen, vice president of public policy at Encode, speaking at the event Image Credits:Tanel Leigher, Responsible Tech Youth Power Fund\n\nAnd they want a seat at the table to help bring change\n\nLeo Wu, 21, remembers the exact moment that led him to start his nonprofit, AI Consensus.\n\nIt was back in 2023 when hype around ChatGPT was becoming widespread. \u201cThere was all this press from universities and media outlets about how it was destroying education,\u201d Wu told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd we just had this feeling that this was not at all the way, the attitude to take.\u201d\n\nSo he launched AI Consensus, which works with students, tech companies, and educational institutions to talk about the best ways students can use AI in school.\n\n\u201cIs it a teenager\u2019s fault for being addicted to Instagram?\u201d Wu told us, capturing what many young people felt when asked. \u201cOr is it the fault of a company that is making this technology addictive?\u201d\n\nWu wants to help students learn how to work with AI while still learning how to think for themselves.\n\nWorking to push regulation was the main way the attendees we spoke to were looking to advocate for themselves. Some were, however, building their own organizations, putting the youth perspective at the forefront.\n\n\u201cI see youth as the bridge between our current government and what the responsible tech future is,\u201d said Jennifer Wang, the founder of Paragon, which connects students with governments looking for perspectives on tech policy issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Generation Patient\u2019s Dave is pushing for more collaboration between the FDA and FTC. She\u2019s also working to help pass a bill through Congress to protect patients from deceptive drug ads online.\n\nEncode\u2019s Billen said he\u2019s considering supporting bills in various states that will require disclosure boxes so people know they are talking to AI and not a human, as well as ones like the bill in California, looking to ban minors from using chatbots. He\u2019s watching the Character.AI lawsuit closely, saying a verdict in that case would be a landmark in shaping future AI regulation.\n\nHis company, Encode, along with others in the tech policy space, filed an amicus brief in support of the mother suing Character.AI over the alleged role it played in her son\u2019s death.\n\nAt one point during the event, Prince Harry sat next to Wu to talk about the opportunities and dangers of AI. They spoke about the need for more accountability and who had the power to push for change. That solution was clear.\n\n\u201cThe people in this room,\u201d Wu said."}
