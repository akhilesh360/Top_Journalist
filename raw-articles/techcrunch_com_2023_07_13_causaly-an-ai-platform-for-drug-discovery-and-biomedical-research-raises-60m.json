Today, another hopeful in the space is announcing a funding round to expand its own contribution to the field. Causaly, a London startup that has built an AI platform to help researchers accelerate the development and testing of drugs, has raised $60 million, a Series B that will be going toward R&D and to continue building out its team.\n\nICONIQ Growth \u2014 the growth-stage fund affiliated with the iconic investment firm of the same name \u2014 is leading the round, with previous backers Index Ventures, Marathon Venture Capital, EBRD, Pentech Ventures and Visionaries Club also participating. The company has now raised $93 million in total and is not disclosing valuation.\n\nCausaly is just over six years old, and Yiannis Kiachopoulos, the CEO who co-founded the company with CTO Artur Saudabayev, said that it already works with 12 of the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical companies and some of the biggest names in medical research, including Gilead, Novo Nordisk, Regeneron, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n\nThese organizations use its cloud-based platform to work across the different stages that go into developing drugs: identifying interesting targets for research and development, determining biomarkers that are specific to those targets and aiding in pathophysiology to better understand a disease in order to determine what might be fixed with the right pharmaceuticals and other therapeutics.\n\nKiachopoulos estimated that the use of Causaly\u2019s platform can reduce the 10-15 years that it might typically take to take an idea from target to the end of trials, down to around \u201cseveral\u201d years \u2014 a major reduction in the budget that needs to be dedicated to the process.\n\nJust as importantly, its platform \u2014 which enables faster modeling and computations based on different chemical permutations and how they work in different environments \u2014 aims to reduce the number of false starts and dead ends that characterize the process of drug discovery.\n\n\u201cFor each drug to make it to the market there are nine that failed,\u201d said Kiachopoulos, working out to a 90% failure rate. Each of those drugs typically costs between $1 billion and $2 billion to develop, according to research from the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. \u201cThis gives us a real chance to accelerate and provide patient and societal benefits.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe immense inefficiency in the biomedical research system is the classic kind of big data problem that suits AI \u2014 which can not only crunch large, multifaceted calculations in real time, but be applied to read images to better understand results on cells and more \u2014 and that is one reason it\u2019s been a popular field not just among AI startups, but investors, too. Just yesterday, Recursion \u2014 an AI-based drug discovery startup that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding \u2014 announced its latest investment, a $50 injection from Nvidia that came with an important strategic partnership: Recursion would use Nvidia\u2019s cloud platform to train its models on giant datasets.\n\nThat deal underscores the immense amount of money that is being pumped into the AI drug discovery space \u2014 overall there have been billions put into startups in the field \u2014 but interestingly it also highlights something else.\n\nI asked Kiachopoulos if compute power was an issue for his startup as well, given that this is indeed one of the big themes among AI startups right now, biomedical or otherwise, and his answer was a surprising \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly a very small fraction will go into compute resources,\u201d he said. This was partly due to how Causaly was built, and partly because of its role in the ecosystem. \u201cSix years ago, when we were starting the company, there were no large language models, so what we have built is not compute-power hungry. We were building natural language querying before Chat GPT, and so we didn\u2019t need large language models now.\u201d\n\nHe did say that it\u2019s working on incorporating more of this into future products, but that this was not going to have a noticeable impact on its compute needs.\n\n\u201cWith LLM it can get easier to query AIs. That is true and we are working on that. But you don\u2019t need to train an LLM from scratch so we can take and fine tune what there is, and fine tuning is a lot less of a drain on compute resources.\u201d\n\nThe other detail that this highlights is that Causaly itself is not in the business of drug discovery: It\u2019s providing tools to others who are. This is also something that differentiates Causaly from other startups in the field.\n\n\u201cOur solution helps biomedical teams, but we are not developing our own therapeutics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a SaaS-based platform, training our scientists to get the most out of our AI. We have very strong partnerships and not competing, nor do we have plans to.\u201d\n\nWith this round Caroline Xie, a general partner at ICONIQ Growth, is joining the startup\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cThe sciences are at a turning point driven by the adoption of AI, and we believe Causaly is a leader in delivering this power to scientists in a highly trusted and verifiable manner,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cCausaly stands out to us as a uniquely powerful and user-oriented platform applying AI to drive significant productivity gains and commercial impact for many major pharmaceutical companies today. We are thrilled to support the entire Causaly team in their mission to revolutionize the way scientists find, visualize, and collaborate on scientific evidence across pharma, life sciences, and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cCausaly gives scientists the power to solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges like never before. It is one of the clearest real-life applications of AI today,\u201d added Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, a partner at Index Ventures. \u201cAlready rolled out by some of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies, Causaly is actively accelerating biomedical research now. We\u2019ve been truly impressed with the level of adoption by leading research organizations, who continue to rapidly expand spend on Causaly, underlying the impact the technology is already having on R&D.\u201d\n\nUpdated to correct the total amount raised to date and the time reduction (from six to \u201cseveral\u201d years)."}
