With a set of features that will be exclusive to the new Pixel at launch, Google is updating Assistant\u2019s abilities to aid in areas like voice typing, navigating businesses\u2019 phone menus, voice message transcription and more.\n\nMany of these capabilities are updates on existing features Google has already offered Pixel device owners. Last year, for example, Google announced support for voice typing on the Pixel 6, and quick phrases \u2014 which let you quick off voice queries without having to say \u201cHey Google\u201d \u2014 were first rolled out to the Pixel 6 and 6a.\n\nNow, Google is updating these and other features to entice consumers to its latest smartphone.\n\nGoogle\u2019s voice typing feature is essentially a voice-to-text solution that allows users to not just type but also edit and send messages using Google Assistant. The company claims it\u2019s 2.5 times faster to use this feature than to type on the keyboard, in fact. Today, Google says the feature will expand to more languages, including Spanish, Italian and French. It will also introduce emoji suggestions and search, which will automatically suggest emojis related to your text and allow users to search for an emoji with their voice. Even if you don\u2019t know the emoji\u2019s proper name, you\u2019ll be able to ask Google Assistant for something like \u201cwinky emoji\u201d or \u201chey emoji,\u201d for instance, and Assistant will select the correct one.\n\nThis feature is not only helpful to speed up typing, in general, it can also be useful as an accessibility feature for people who have difficulties typing directly on their device\u2019s keyboard.\n\nAnother new feature is an expansion on Google\u2019s clever \u201cDirect My Call\u201d service, launched last year for the Pixel 6 devices. The feature is designed to help you navigate the complicated phone menus you encounter when you dial a business\u2019s 1-800 number. Direct My Call uses Google Assistant to translate the various phone tree options for you so you don\u2019t have to listen, you can just read through the options presented on your phone screen and then tap the one that offers the information you want or gets you to a live agent.\n\nWith the Pixel 7, Direct My Call is being updated so you can actually see the phone tree menus before they\u2019re spoken, which saves even more time. To accomplish this, Google says it\u2019s leveraging its Google Duplex AI technology, which has already been put to use in other areas, like making your reservations by phone for you.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In other words, Duplex has already called the business and learned the menu options before the user places the call for the first time, allowing it to present the phone tree options. But this is not available for any phone number that has a phone tree, we should note. Instead, it\u2019s focused on U.S.-based businesses that are enrolled in Direct My Call, Google explains.\n\nDirect my Call uses the same technology as Duplex \u2014 the technology that also uses AI to call local businesses to ensure hours of operation shown in Search or Maps are up to date. That means businesses don\u2019t need to opt into this feature or take any integration steps, Google tells TechCrunch. Duplex technology works by proactively calling toll-free numbers to understand phone tree options in advance of users calling these numbers themselves. The amount of pre-loaded, toll-free numbers will increase over time, the company added.\n\nMeanwhile, for those who love voice messages when texting, but hate listening to others\u2019 messages back, another new feature will be a big improvement. Google Assistant will now be able to transcribe those messages as soon as you receive them, so you can easily read what the person had to say.\n\nOther updates are more minor, including an addition to the quick phrases that let you access Assistant without the \u201cHey Google\u201d command. Pixel 7 owners will be able to now say \u201cSilence\u201d without the \u201cHey Google\u201d voice command to dismiss incoming calls they don\u2019t want to answer.\n\nGoogle will also update its Recorder voice recording app to include speaker labels to differentiate who\u2019s talking.\n\nGoogle Assistant will power the Pixel 7\u2019s new At a Glance feature, which puts information on your home or lock screen, like weather forecasts, package delivery updates, video feeds from a Nest doorbell, flight information and more.\n\nAssistant technology is coming to the new Pixel Watch, too, allowing device owners to send messages, set reminders, control smart home devices, start a run and more, using their voice. And it will work on the Pixel Buds and upcoming Google Pixel Tablet, arriving next year, as well.\n\nThe Google Assistant updates leverage the Tensor chip design Google introduced last year for the Pixel 6. But at launch, the new features will be exclusive to the Pixel 7 line."}
