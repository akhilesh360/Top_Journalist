The company said users subscribed to this plan will be able to see content in 1080p resolution (up from 720p) with support for two concurrent streams.\n\nThese benefits are rolling out to users in Canada and Spain today. People using the ad-supported plans in other 10 markets \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 will get these features this month.\n\n\u201cWe believe these enhancements will make our offering even more attractive to a broader set of consumers and further strengthen engagement for existing and new subscribers to the ads plan,\u201d the company said in its letter to investors.\n\nNetflix launched the ad-supported plan last November at $6.99 per month and it\u2019s already seeing positive results.\n\nThe streaming company said that in the U.S., it\u2019s earning more average revenue per membership through the ad-supported plan than the standard plan, which costs $15.99 per month.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Netflix\u2019s CFO Spencer Neumann said that the company has rolled out new content to the ad-supported tier in the past quarter, bringing it to \u201c95% plus\u201d parity with other higher-priced plans.\n\nHe mentioned that the ad-supported plan is also showing beneficial results for the business.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
