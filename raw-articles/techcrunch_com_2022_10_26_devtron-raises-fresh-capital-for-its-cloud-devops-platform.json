As a result, DevOps teams today have too many narrow choices that don\u2019t work together seamlessly or that can\u2019t be integrated into a single platform.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the opinion of Prashant Ghildiyal, one of the co-founders of Devtron, a startup offering a platform to address what he believes are the top challenges facing the DevOps space. A container management system, Devtron offers a low-code delivery platform optimized for Kubernetes. (\u201cContainers\u201d are packages of software that contain the necessary elements to run in any environment.) The platform handles app management, security and more, providing an interface that abstracts away the underlying infrastructure.\n\nTo Ghildiyal\u2019s point, there\u2019s evidence to suggest that there\u2019s a gap between DevOps adoption and success. In a 2019 Harvard Business Review survey, only 10% of developers said that their companies were successful at building and deploying software quickly, with less than half (48%) saying their organization always relies on DevOps methodologies. A separate, more recent poll by infrastructure automation company Puppet found that companies were hitting a number of DevOps speed bumps in the race to be cloud native, including a skills shortage, issues with legacy architecture, organizational resistance to change and limited or lack of automation.\n\nInvestors are keen on Devtron, as evidenced by the company today closing a $12 million funding round led by Insight Partners. \u201cDevtron integrates with products across the lifecycle of microservices, and in particular Kubernetes, enabling its users to deploy faster and automate their CI/CD pipelines without worrying about Kubernetes knowhow,\u201d Insight Partners principal Josh Zelman told TechCrunch via email.\n\nGhildiyal says that he and Devtron\u2019s other co-founders, Nishant Kumar and Rajesh Razdan, experienced the challenges of scaling DevOps firsthand in their previous roles as heads of technology and software architects at various startups. Their experiences informed Devtron\u2019s design, which Ghildiyal describes as \u201cDevOps in a box,\u201d with tools that provide audit logs and metrics showing the state of an organization\u2019s DevOps maturity.\n\nDevtron also provides tools for access controls and policy management, as well as environment orchestration, software delivery workflow and cost. \u201cThis saves significant time and resources to build and deploy in production,\u201d Zelman added.\n\nGhildiyal sees Devtron competing against formidable incumbent vendors like GitLab and Harness in a DevOps market that was worth an estimated $4 billion in 2020, according to Global Market Insights. (That\u2019s not to mention startups like Render, which raised $20 million last November after winning our Disrupt SF 2019 Startup Battlefield.) When asked about clients, Ghildiyal said Devtron has \u201cseveral\u201d unicorns and growth-stage companies as commercial customers, but he declined to reveal names \u2014 or Devtron\u2019s revenue.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
