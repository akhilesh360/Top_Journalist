Today, Mavenir \u2014 one of the hopefuls in that space, with a focus on Open Radio Access Networks and related services for 5G networks \u2014 is announcing $100 million in funding to expand its technology and its customer base.\n\nThe first of those will involve bringing more AI tools into the mix, the company said; and as for the latter, the company already has a sizable business: It currently has more than 250 service provider and enterprise customers across 120 countries, services that altogether cover more than half of the world\u2019s mobile subscribers. The plan will be not just to continue expanding that pool, but to build more services to sell to current customers.\n\nMavenir described the funding as \u201canchored\u201d by Siris, a PE firm that\u2019s been backing the company for years. Mavenir is not naming further investors in this latest capital injection, but other existing backers include Koch and Pendrell. Koch and Siri also participated in the company\u2019s last financing, a $155 million round in October 2022. It\u2019s not disclosing its valuation but we have contacted the company to ask. As a point of reference, Mavenir was valued at around $2.5 billion in 2020.\n\nMavenir has been through a couple of different ownership structures, including at one point being majority owned by Siris and used as the umbrella for a roll-up of telecoms software vendors Mitel and Xura \u2014 both also of the bigger consolidation trend \u2014 to capitalize on new opportunities with 5G networks. After selling a $500 million stake to Koch in 2021, Siris remained at least a partial shareholder, and given the $255 million raised in the last seven months, it seems Siris is back into investment mode with the company now.\n\nMavenir is part of the wave of companies that also includes companies like DriveNets, Arrcus and even AWS looking to capitalize on the so-called trend for digital transformation in the telecoms industry. Telecoms carriers are on the hunt for more ways to bring down their own capital and operational expenditures while providing more flexible services to business and service provider customers as they scale up and down. Kit from the likes of Cisco, Juniper and Arista represents the legacy, incumbent approach to network provision and operation; now, the pitch is that software, delivered via cloud services, is the new and better solution.\n\n\u201cThis new capital will allow us to accelerate our capabilities in automation, sustainability, and use of AI as we enable our customers to efficiently deploy and operate Open RAN based end-to-end cloud-native networks,\u201d said Mavenir CEO and president Pardeep Kohli in a statement. \u201cOur unique strategy incorporates best practices from the hyperscale, cloud and IT industries, to transform how the world connects and builds the future of networks.\u201d Kohli has been with Mavenir for years \u2014 initially directly with the company and then reappointed the head of the business after his next employer \u2014 Xura, where he was also the CEO \u2014 was acquired and rolled up into Mavenir.\n\n\u201cThis investment enables Mavenir to further scale its business and maintain its leadership in Open RAN and 5G transformation,\u201d said Hubert de Pesquidoux, a Siris executive partner who is also chairman of Mavenir, in a statement. \u201cWe firmly believe in the automated networks of the future that are cloud-native, AI-native and Green-native, and we are confident that Mavenir\u2019s innovations are essential in driving that evolution.\u201d"}
