In those first few years, the startup processed over a million applications. Its no-exam underwriting platform gained traction during the COVID pandemic as traditional medical exams were paused. As it grew its D2C business, Bestow in parallel developed software to help modernize the whole process.\n\nRecognizing the value in that software, Bestow in 2024 sold its insurance carrier and consumer business to Sammons Financial Group for an undisclosed amount. It switched its focus to providing its software and services to other life insurance companies so those companies could \u201cbecome more digital\u201d and thus, more efficiently serve their customers.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the Dallas-based company is announcing that it has raised $120 million in Series D funding to launch new products and underwriting capabilities, it has told TechCrunch exclusively. The fundraise, which O\u2019Banion described as \u201coversubscribed,\u201d was a mix of $75 million in primary and $45 million in secondary investments.\n\nGoldman Sachs Alternatives\u2019 Growth Equity and ex-Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block\u2019s Smith Point Capital co-led the investment. In addition to the equity financing, Bestow also secured a $50 million credit facility from TriplePoint Capital. O\u2019Banion declined to reveal Bestow\u2019s valuation, noting only that it had \u201capproximately doubled\u201d since the company raised $70 million in a Series C round in December 2020. With this latest financing, Bestow has raised more than $300 million in equity funding to date.\n\nO\u2019Banion also declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying that Bestow\u2019s annual recurring revenue grew 3x in 2024, and \u201c10x\u201d over the last two years. Its revenue model is enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) and performance-based. The bulk of its revenue comes from usage fees.\n\n\n\nAshwin Gupta, a Goldman Sachs Alternatives\u2019 Growth Equity team partner, told TechCrunch that he was attracted to backing Bestow for several reasons. For one, its founders were repeat founders who had \u201csuccessfully pivoted the business.\u201d (Melbourne also co-founded BeautyBio and is a founding member of Presidio Title. Abelmann co-founded publicly traded Invitation Homes.)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Gupta, who is joining Bestow\u2019s board as part of the financing, also noted that he was impressed by Bestow\u2019s ability to have won several large customers who were expanding their use of its platform.\n\nIts customers include Nationwide, Transamerica, USAA, Sammons Financial Group, and Equitable, among others.\n\nOther backers include Breyer Capital, Valar Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Core Innovation Ventures, Morpheus Ventures, and Sammons Financial.\n\nBestow, which has 167 employees, currently operates in the U.S. and is considering an international expansion."}
