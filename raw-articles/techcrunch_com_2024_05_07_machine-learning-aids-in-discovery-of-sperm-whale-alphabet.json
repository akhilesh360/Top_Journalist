Results from the study, which were published under the title, \u201cContextual and Combinatorial Structure in Sperm Whale Vocalizations,\u201d point to key breakthroughs in our understanding of cetacean communication.\n\nThe study deals with codas \u2014 a series of clicks that serve different linguistic functions. \u201cWhat we have discovered is that there is previously undescribed variation in the coda structure,\u201d CSAIL director Daniela Rus told TechCrunch. \u201cWe have discovered that coda types are not arbitrary, but rather they form a newly discovered combinatory coding system.\u201d\n\nWhile whale vocalization has been a key subject of research for decades, the teams behind this new research suggest that they\u2019ve uncovered a level of previously unknown nuance among the chatty sea mammals. The paper notes that previous research has noted 150 different sperm whale codas.\n\n\u201cA subset of these have been shown to encode information about caller and clan identity,\u201d it explains. \u201cHowever, almost everything else about the sperm whale communication system, including basic questions about its structure and information-carrying capacity, remains unknown.\u201d\n\nThe teams drew on work from Roger Payne, the pioneering marine biologist who passed away last June. Payne\u2019s most influential work involved the songs of humpback whales. \u201cHe has really inspired us to want to use our most advanced technologies to want to have a deeper understanding of the whales,\u201d says Rus.\n\nThe teams deployed machine learning solutions to analyze a dataset of 8,719 sperm whale codas collected by researcher Shane Gero off the coast of the small eastern Caribbean island, Dominica.\n\n\u201cWe would get the inputs, and then we adjust our machine learning, to visualize better and to understand more,\u201d explains Rus. \u201cAnd then we would analyze the output with a biologist.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

A richer picture forms when the sounds are studied in context, as exchanges between whales. Contextual details are classified using music terminology. That includes tempo, rhythm, ornamentation and rubato. From there, the team isolated what it refers to as a sperm whale phonetic alphabet.\n\n\u201cThis phonetic alphabet makes it possible to systematically explain the observed variability in the coda structure,\u201d says Rus. \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s possible that this is the first instance outside of human language where a communication provides an example of the linguistic concept of duality of patterning. That refers to a set of individually meaningless elements that can be combined to form larger meaningful units, sort of like combining syllables into words.\u201d\n\nThe meaning of those \u201cwords\u201d take on different meanings based on various context. The paper adds:\n\nOur results demonstrate that sperm whale vocalizations form a complex combinatorial communication system: the seemingly arbitrary inventory of coda types can be explained by combinations of rhythm, tempo, rubato, and ornamentation features. Sizable combinatorial vocalization systems are exceedingly rare in nature; however, their use by sperm whales shows that they are not uniquely human, and can arise from dramatically different physiological, ecological, and social pressures.\n\nWhile the breakthrough is exciting for all involved, there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, first with sperm whales and then potentially broadening out to other species like humpbacks.\n\n\u201cWe decided to go to sperm whales because we had an extensive dataset, and we have the possibility of collecting many more datasets,\u201d says Rus. \u201cAlso, because the clicks form a kind of discrete communication system, it is much easier to analyze than a continuous communication system. But even Roger Payne\u2019s work showed that the songs of humpback whales are not random. There are segments that get repeated and there is interesting structure there. We just haven\u2019t gotten to do an in-depth study.\u201d"}
