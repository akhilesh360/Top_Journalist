Its first title, Ingress, was widely praised for its unique, geography-based take on territory control, but the company truly skyrocketed to fame with Pok\u00e9mon Go, which took off in 2016 and quickly became a global phenomenon.\n\nIts subsequent titles have been relatively successful, but not at the scale Pok\u00e9mon Go enjoyed. In 2022, the company let go of 8% of its staff and shuttered four projects, including Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. In 2023, it laid off 230 employees and canceled its NBA and Marvel games.\n\nLast year, it updated its Scaniverse app to let users create models of real-world objects and provide the data to developers. In November, the company said it wanted to build a large geospatial model that would use machine learning to \u201cunderstand a scene and connect it to millions of other scenes globally.\u201d"}
