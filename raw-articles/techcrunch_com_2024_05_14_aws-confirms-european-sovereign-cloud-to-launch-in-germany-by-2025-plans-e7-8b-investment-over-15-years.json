AWS added that it plans to invest \u20ac7.8 billion ($8.5 billion) in the facility through 2040.\n\nThe announcement, evidently timed to coincide with the AWS Summit Berlin being held in the German capital today and tomorrow, comes some seven months after AWS first revealed plans for a sovereign cloud.\n\nNavigating regulations\n\nAWS has long offered localized data storage and processing in the European region, but public sector bodies and organizations operating in certain highly regulated industries have been slower to transition to the public cloud due to data (mis)management concerns. That is, regardless of whatever policies and promises a hyperscaler might have in place, the data is still ultimately under the control of a U.S. tech giant.\n\nThus, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud comes with stricter data controls, allowing all qualifying customers to keep all their metadata within the EU \u2014 AWS employees based anywhere outside the EU would be unable to access anything contained within the bloc.\n\nIn other words, the sovereign cloud will be \u201cphysically and logically separate\u201d from all other AWS regions.\n\nAWS had originally distanced itself from the \u201csovereign cloud\u201d concept \u2014 Amazon chief security officer (CSO) Stephen Schmidt went so far as to call the sovereign cloud \u201ca marketing term more than anything else.\u201d However, in late 2022, AWS announced its \u201cdigital sovereignty pledge,\u201d which set about enshrining its data control commitments in stone.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company also touts that it will support \u201can average 2,800 full-time equivalent jobs in local German businesses\u201d annually through its supply chain, spanning disciplines such as construction, facility maintenance and telecommunications."}
