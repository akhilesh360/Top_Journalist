That\u2019s one reason why public search service startups rarely succeed. Another is that it\u2019s expensive to index a huge number of websites (Google has an estimated tens of billions of pages indexed), but one Y Combinator-backed company, Andi, is undeterred \u2014 forging ahead to build an AI assistant that provides answers instead of links when searching online.\n\nAndi was founded by Angela Hoover, who registered for YC\u2019s Startup School after dropping out of college and got into YC\u2019s Winter 2022 Batch. After working overseas in construction and with Microsoft as a data center project administrator, Hoover met Andi\u2019s co-founder, Jed White, at the Denver airport upon her return to the U.S.\n\nHoover and White \u2014 who had a background in AI and search, specifically content quality ranking, querying and classification \u2014 talked about how bad web search had become for things like travel and what it would take to build a new type of search engine from scratch.\n\n\u201cGen-Z hates Google. To us, search is broken. We live on our phones in messaging apps with visual feeds like TikTok and Instagram,\u201d Hoover told TechCrunch in an email interview. She\u2019s not conjecturing \u2014 Google execs have admitted as much. \u201cI hear my friends say constantly that Google sucks. Search results are overwhelmed with ads, SEO spam and clutter. Gen-Z is so desperate for an alternative that we\u2019re using TikTok as a search engine. We hate the invasive creepy ads, and how Google is Big Brother and surveils everything.\u201d\n\nHoover offers Andi\u2019s AI-powered assistant as an alternative. The general-purpose system attempts to find and extract answers to questions, combining large language models akin to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 with live web data.\n\nBehind the scenes, Andi extracts information from web results ranked for relevance to the question being asked as well as overall quality (although it\u2019s not clear how Andi defines \u201cquality\u201d). Depending on the subject matter, the platform uses different AI systems tailored for specific verticals (e.g. factual knowledge, programming or consumer health) and language models that generate answers by combining knowledge across multiple sources (e.g. Wolfram Alpha, Forbes, The New York Times, etc.).\n\nIt\u2019s one step beyond Google\u2019s featured snippets, which pull text from webpages to answer commonly asked questions, and closer to so-called \u201ccognitive search\u201d engines such as Amazon Kendra and Microsoft SharePoint Syntex that draw on knowledge bases to cobble together answers. Startups like Hebbia, Kagi and You.com also leverage AI to return specific content from the web in response to queries as opposed to straightforward lists of results.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Unlike some of its competitors, Hoover claims it doesn\u2019t charge for its service nor record personally identifiable information. Andi also doesn\u2019t log and store searches or the results people read or click on, only using coarse location data to improve the relevance of search results.\n\n\u201cEven when we add the option for user accounts in future, we will only collect and retain sufficient data to help our customers use the service effectively, when they want to create an account or be remembered between devices and sessions, and to improve the service we provide,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cUsers tell us that Andi can save them 15 or 20 minutes searching, and have been asking us to let them use it with their own team and personal data \u2026 As we improve the question answering tech and add support to connect to private data sources, we think this has massive potential.\u201d\n\nTo filter out info that might be misleading \u2014 or patently untrue \u2014 Hoover says that Andi uses techniques including blocklists and ranking metrics. Misinformation is an evolving issue, of course \u2014 one Google itself has struggled with. But Hoover expressed confidence in the technical steps Andi has taken to mitigate the impact.\n\n\u201cEvery other new search startup out there is making yet another weaker copy of Google with the same cluttered page of blue links targeted at a web browser, with more or less variation on ads and privacy practices,\u201d she averred. \u201cThe content you see in [Andi\u2019s] results is retrieved from the source live wherever possible, rather than from a stale index. The question answering is improving rapidly, and in many areas is already excellent.\u201d\n\nIn a quick experiment, I fed a couple of controversial queries into Andi and found that the search engine handled them quite adeptly, consistently pointing to factual sources. A search for \u201cWho really won the 2020 election?\u201d yielded the answer \u201cJoe Biden,\u201d while the query \u201cAre COVID-19 vaccines fake?\u201d pulled an article from Forbes debunking pandemic conspiracy theories.\n\nAndi is still very much in alpha and intends to stay lean while it iterates based on feedback from early users, Hoover says. The startup will have tough decisions to make. As a New Yorker notes, search algorithms are susceptible to various biases, for example only prioritizing websites that use modern web technologies. They also open the door to bad actors. In 2020, Pinterest took advantage of a quirk of Google\u2019s image search algorithm to surface more of its content in Google Image searches.\n\nAs it wrestles with these issues, Andi\u2019s team continues to suss out its business model. While the core service will remain free, Hoover says that Andi will eventually offer paid pro and business plans with premium features and API access, letting customers use Andi\u2019s search and question-answering capabilities with paid content, personal data, and internal company and team data.\n\nPaid features are probably the right route to go, considering Google\u2019s share of the global search market has held steady at more than 90% for most of the past decade. Bing trails with 3.4%, followed by Yahoo! (full disclosure: TechCrunch\u2019s parent company) at 1.34%, according to Statcounter.\n\nTo fund the development of these features and potential partnerships with alternative search engines, Andi recently raised $2.5 million, which including backing from YC, Gaingels, GoodWater Capital, K20 Fund, Acacia Venture Capital Partners, Fepo Capital and BBQ Capital, as well as a small family and friends round.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kept our burn rate low, working as digital nomads out of Mexico to extend our runway, and staying frugal. Even after we add AI developers and increase our model training costs, we have well over two years of runway,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cWe\u2019re using the funds to improve our proprietary generative AI for complex question answering, and the \u2018search of vertical searches and APIs\u2019 tech that Andi uses to combine large language models with live data, especially: AI model development and training, adding some more AI developers to our team and hosting and inference costs as we start to grow usage once we get closer to product market fit \u2026 At this early stage, we\u2019re focused on making really great search that our users love, ahead of generating revenue.\u201d\n\nAndi doesn\u2019t collect detailed metrics, but Hoover estimates that the search engine has around 5,000 users at present. Andi plans to add a full-time AI developer before the end of the year, which would bring its total headcount to three, including Hoover and White."}
