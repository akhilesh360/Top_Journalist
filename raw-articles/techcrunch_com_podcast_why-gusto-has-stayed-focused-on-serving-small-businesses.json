The three founders of payroll and benefits startup Gusto all found that out separately, running small businesses of their own, before linking up to try to fix the broken SMB payroll system in 2013.\n\nJosh Reeves, a co-founder and current CEO of Gusto, said on a recent episode of TechCrunch\u2019s Found podcast that while the founders got interested in this area due to personal painpoints, they didn\u2019t just want to build a company that would serve their own problems.\n\n\u201cWe immediately started talking to customers,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEven though we were based in Silicon Valley, we actually were really focused on mainstream small business. I love reminding folks there\u2019s more dentist offices in the U.S. than tech startups. We would go out and meet them, talk to them, interview them, get feedback.\u201d\n\nReeves talked about how they built the company from there to today, 11 years and 300,000 customers later. Gusto has since added healthcare benefits too, a direct response to customer request, Reeves said. Gusto has also navigated rising competition in the space and helping companies transition to serving a remote workforce during the pandemic.\n\nAll the while, the company has stayed laser-focused on serving small and medium-sized businesses, a more fragmented market compared to say enterprise, as opposed to moving up the stack or taking on larger customers.\n\n\u201cI would describe Gusto as being a great product for one to 500 person companies in all of the United States,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cBut the reality is, there\u2019s 6.2 million employers in America and 4 million are less than five employees, over half are less than five employees.\u201d\n\nReeves also talked about how more than a decade in all three co-founders are still involved with the company, how they plan to continue to expand and offer other tools for small businesses and why they think they are just getting started.\n\n\u201cWe love fixing stuff in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cThe truth is, we\u2019re still early. If you look at marketshare, walletshare, and the product mix we have live today, there\u2019s just a lot more work to do. So we\u2019re eager to go get that work done.\u201d"}
