Lawmakers in the Florida Senate had already voted to advance the legislation, but a bill requires both legislative chambers to pass before it can become law.\n\nThe bill would have required social media firms to \u201cprovide a mechanism to decrypt end-to-end encryption when law enforcement obtains a subpoena,\u201d which are typically issued by law enforcement agencies and without judicial oversight.\n\nDigital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation called the bill \u201cdangerous and dumb.\u201d Security professionals have long argued that it is impossible to create a secure backdoor that cannot also be maliciously abused, and encryption backdoors put user data at risk of data breaches."}
