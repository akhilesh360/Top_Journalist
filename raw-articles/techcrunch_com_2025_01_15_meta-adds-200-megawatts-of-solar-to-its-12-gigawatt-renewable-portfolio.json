The new solar farm is a short distance from one of Meta\u2019s existing data centers in Texas.\n\nTech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups, announcing a flurry of deals late last year. Google and Kairos have teamed up to deploy 500 megawatts of small modular nuclear reactors starting in 2030. Amazon has signed a deal with X-Energy for 300 megawatts that will come online in the early 2030s.\n\nMeta, not to be left out, announced in December that it was seeking proposals from nuclear power developers for 1 to 4 gigawatts of power by the early 2030s as well. Companies have until February 7 to submit plans.\n\nBut even as nuclear has grabbed plenty of headlines, renewable power sources have continued to quietly add capacity, allowing companies like Meta to expand their computing power today. Google is backing a $20 billion renewable deal with Intersect Power and TPG Rise, and Microsoft is working with Acadia Infrastructure Capital on a $9 billion deal.\n\nThe speed at which renewables can be deployed will be one of the largest challenges facing nuclear startups. Meta\u2019s new solar farm, for example, is expected to come online in 2025."}
