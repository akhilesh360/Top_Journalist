Unfortunately, much like that first attempt, it seems the company\u2019s spacecraft may have tipped on its side.\n\nThe lunar lander, called Athena, touched down on the moon\u2019s surface at around 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday. It\u2019s the second private spacecraft to land on the moon this week, after Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost touched down on March 2.\n\nIntuitive Machines\u2019 chief technology officer said in a post-landing press conference that Athena is somewhere inside the 50-meter landing zone on Mons Mouton, a flat-topped mountain on the moon\u2019s south pole. But he said the company was still working on determining where, exactly, Athena touched down.\n\nCEO Steve Altemus added during the conference that the company doesn\u2019t think Athena is at the \u201ccorrect attitude\u201d \u2014 spaceflight speak for \u201cit probably tipped over.\u201d\n\nAltemus otherwise praised the mission, which he said went much more smoothly than last year\u2019s trip to the moon.\n\nThe rest of Athena\u2019s mission now hangs in the balance. The spacecraft, which took off for the moon aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on February 26, is carrying a number of technologies that Intuitive Machines hoped to test out.\n\nOne is a passive laser retroreflector array, which Intuitive Machines hopes to use to communicate with other incoming or orbiting spacecraft. It\u2019s a crucial piece of technology for NASA\u2019s hopes to build a permanent moon base \u2014 so much so that the space agency awarded Intuitive Machines a $4.8 billion contract late last year to build out the communications system. (Only $150 million of that is guaranteed.)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
