And it\u2019s technically different than the permits that ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber possess.\n\nTesla was granted a transportation charter permit, or TCP. A TCP means the company \u2014 in this case Tesla \u2014 owns the vehicles and uses employees as drivers, according to the CPUC, which regulates human-driven and driverless ride-hailing services in the state. A TCP is for companies that want to offer prearranged transportation services like roundtrip sightseeing, according to the commission.\n\nUber and Lyft hold transportation network company (TNC) permits. TNCs use an online-enabled application like a smartphone app to connect drivers using their personal vehicles with paying passengers.\n\nTesla plans to initially use its TCP permit to transport employees on a prearranged basis and in vehicles owned by the automaker, according to its application. Tesla has agreed to notify the CPUC when it transitions to transporting members of the public.\n\nImportantly, Tesla\u2019s application doesn\u2019t seek participation in the commission\u2019s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service Programs in either a drivered or driverless capacity. That doesn\u2019t mean Tesla won\u2019t eventually apply for those permits. If it does, Tesla will also need to obtain permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicle testing and deployment in the state.\n\nTesla does not possess authority from the DMV to offer any driverless rides for testing or deployment purposes, according to state regulators.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised the robotaxi service will begin in June using its own fleet vehicles that are equipped with the yet-to-be-released \u201cunsupervised\u201d version of its Full Self-Driving software."}
