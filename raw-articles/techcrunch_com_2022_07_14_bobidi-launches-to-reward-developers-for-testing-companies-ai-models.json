In a 2018 report, Gartner predicted that 85% of AI projects will deliver erroneous outcomes due to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing them. Even Big Tech companies aren\u2019t immune to the pitfalls \u2014 for one client, IBM ultimately failed to deliver an AI-powered cancer diagnostics system that wound up costing $62 million over 4 years.\n\nInspired by \u201cbug bounty\u201d programs, Jeong-Suh Choi and Soohyun Bae founded Bobidi, a platform aimed at helping companies validate their AI systems by exposing the systems to the global data science community. With Bobidi, Bae and Choi sought to build a product that lets customers connect AI systems with the bug-hunting community in a \u201csecure\u201d way, via an API.\n\nThe idea is to let developers test AI systems and biases \u2014 that is, the edge cases where the systems perform poorly \u2014 to reduce the time needed for validation, Choi explained in an email interview. Bae was previously a senior engineer at Google and led augmented reality mapping at Niantic, while Choi was a senior manager at eBay and headed the \u201cpeople engineering\u201d team at Facebook. The two met at a tech industry function about 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cBy the time bias or flaws are revealed from the model, the damage is already irrevocable,\u201d Choi said. \u201cFor example, natural language processing algorithms [like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3] are often found to be making problematic comments, or mis-responding to those comments, related to hate speech, discrimination, and insults. Using Bobidi, the community can \u2018pre-test\u2019 the algorithm and find those loopholes, which is actually very powerful as you can test the algorithm with a lot of people under certain conditions that represent social and political contexts that change constantly.\u201d\n\nTo test models, the Bobidi \u201ccommunity\u201d of developers builds a validation dataset for a given system. As developers attempt to find loopholes in the system, customers get an analysis that includes patterns of false negatives and positives and the metadata associated with them (e.g., the number of edge cases).\n\nExposing sensitive systems and models to the outside world might give some companies pause, but Choi asserts that Bobidi \u201cauto-expires\u201d models after a certain number of days so that they can\u2019t be reverse-engineered. Customers pay for service based on the number of \u201clegit\u201d attempts made by the community, which works out to a dollar ($0.99) per 10 attempts.\n\nChoi notes that the amount of money developers can make through Bobidi \u2014 $10 to $20 per hour \u2014 is substantially above the minimum wage in many regions around the world. Assuming Choi\u2019s estimations are rooted in fact, Bobidi bucks the trend in the data science industry, which tends to pay data validators and labelers poorly. The annotators of the widely used ImageNet computer vision dataset made a median wage of $2 per hour, one study found, with only 4% making more than $7.25 per hour.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In 2017, the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing Laboratory at the University of Maryland launched a platform called Break It, Build It that let researchers submit models to users tasked with coming up with examples to defeat them. Elsewhere, Meta maintains a platform called Dynabench that has users \u201cfool\u201d models designed to analyze sentiment, answer questions, detect hate speech and more.\n\nBut Bae and Choi believe the \u201cgamified\u201d approach will help Bobidi stand out from the pack. While it\u2019s early days, the vendor claims to have customers in augmented reality and computer vision startups, including Seerslab, Deepixel and Gunsens.\n\nThe traction was enough to convince several investors to pledge money toward the venture. Today, Bobidi closed a $5.8 million seed round with participation from Y Combinator, We Ventures, Hyundai Motor Group, Scrum Ventures, New Product Experimentation (NPE) at Meta, Lotte Ventures, Atlas Pac Capital and several undisclosed angel investors.\n\nOf note, Bobidi is among the first investments for NPE, which shifted gears last year from building consumer-facing apps to making seed-stage investments in AI-focused startups. When contacted for comment, head of NPE investments Sunita Parasuraman said via email: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to back the talented founders of Bobidi, who are helping companies better validate AI models with an innovative solution driven by people around the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cBobidi is a mashup between community and AI, a unique combination of expertise that we share,\u201d Choi added. \u201cWe believe that the era of big data is ending and we\u2019re about to enter the new era of quality data. It means we are moving from the era \u2014 where the focus was to build the best model given with the datasets \u2014 to the new era, where people are tasked to find the best dataset given with the model-complete opposite approach.\u201d\n\nChoi said that the proceeds from the seed round will be put toward hiring \u2014 Bobidi currently has 12 employees \u2014 and building \u201ccustomer insights experiences\u201d and various \u201ccore machine learning technologies.\u201d The company hopes to triple the size of its team by the end of the year despite economic headwinds."}
