That\u2019s why they\u2019re attracting an increasing amount of attention and investment from venture firms, which see the market opportunity growing into the distant future.\n\nAI systems are made up of many components, one of which is features. Features are the individual variables that act like inputs in the system. In thinking about features, it can be helpful to visualize a table, where the data used by AI systems is organized into rows of examples (data from which the system learns to make predictions) and columns of attributes (data describing those examples). Features are attributes used to describe each example \u2014 an AI spam detector tool might use features like words in the email body, for example, or a sender\u2019s contact information.\n\nWorking with features tends to be an ad hoc process within a single AI system. But at the enterprise scale, where data science teams are responsible for maintaining dozens to thousands of systems, a place to manage and track features becomes a necessity.\n\nEnter the feature store, a centralized repository for organizing, storing and serving the features that AI systems rely on. Introduced as a concept by Uber in 2017, feature stores provide a unified place to build and share features across different teams in an organization.\n\n\u201cFeature stores sit at the intersection of data and machine learning,\u201d Michael Del Balso, the CEO of Tecton.ai, a startup developing feature store software for businesses, told TechCrunch in an email. \u201c[Feature stores are] an essential part of the \u2018MLOps\u2019 stack because they enable data teams to quickly, reliably build high-quality features using real-time data and serve those features in production for real-time inference. They serve as the interface between data and [AI] models.\u201d\n\nGoing beyond simply a database, feature stores allow data engineers to see statistics on features, including which features have been used, where they\u2019ve been used and the impact they\u2019ve had on models. Feature stores also transform data, allowing users to aggregate, filter and join features without necessarily needing to code. (Think aggregating orders at a restaurant to get the feature value \u201cnumber of orders over the past 30 minutes.\u201d)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

[They often also] include built-in monitoring capabilities to monitor pipeline health, data drift, service levels and more.\u201d\n\nFeature stores promise to enhance collaboration between teams while streamlining the development of AI systems. As the demand for them grows, tech giants and startups like Tecton are developing products to meet the need \u2014 and investors are backing them enthusiastically.\n\nSince its founding in 2019, Tecton has raised $60 million from venture firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital to build out its feature store platform. Rasgo and Molecula, two competitors, have each snagged about $20 million in venture capital.\n\nGoogle and AWS now offer feature store solutions, too. So do later-stage AI development platform startups such as Databricks and Splice.\n\n\u201cInvestors have seen companies across various industries build new products and revenue streams via machine learning and AI. They understand the need for solutions that enable this trend for the masses,\u201d Jared Parker, the co-founder and CEO of Rasgo, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cFeature stores provide an accelerated path to getting models into production while also enabling centralization, collaboration and governance of the data pipelines that drive machine learning.\u201d\n\nSupercharging the feature stores segment is the broader boom in MLOps, the set of practices for deploying AI systems in production reliably and efficiently. According to Cognilytica, the global market for MLOps platforms \u2014 which can include feature store products and services \u2014 will be worth $4 billion by 2025, up from $350 million in 2019.\n\nAs Del Balso explained, the upticks signal the enterprise\u2019s embrace of \u201coperational\u201d machine learning after years of struggling to deploy AI systems into production \u2014 and maintain them afterward. According to a 2020 Forrester study, 41% of companies say they\u2019ve experienced challenges operationalizing any machine learning models and \u201clack the process to do so.\u201d One 2019 white paper suggested that about 85% of AI projects fail eventually \u2014 even when companies prioritize AI and machine learning over other IT initiatives.\n\n\u201cOperational machine learning consists of running machine learning in production to power customer-facing applications and to automate business processes,\u201d Del Balso said. \u201cOperational machine learning can be used to support a very broad range of use cases, including fraud detection, real-time pricing, product recommendations, risk assessment and more. It\u2019s the future, and enterprises that become good at building and deploying operational machine learning will acquire a significant competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nSo what does that mean for the future of feature stores? Flush with capital and interested customers, Del Balso sees an opportunity to take advantage of the cloud to make features based on public data \u2014 e.g., weather and stock prices \u2014 broadly accessible. He also expects automation will play a larger role in feature stores, helping suggest the reuse of existing features and perhaps even creating new features as needed.\n\nHis predictions align with those in Deloitte\u2019s Tech Trends 2021 report. The firm writes that feature stores may eventually be able to predict the demand for certain features based on the types of data being modeled, potentially improving the performance of AI systems by reducing the delay in serving features.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, a data scientist would simply say, \u2018This is what I\u2019m trying to predict,\u2019 and the feature store would suggest (or build) the most predictive features for that use case,\u201d Del Balso said.\n\nFrom Parker\u2019s perspective, data transformation and feature management are the frontiers the industry must master to capture the entire value of AI \u2014 and feature stores are the way to achieve this.\n\n\u201cA model is only as good as its data, and too many projects never make it to production because of the sheer time it takes to prepare data for machine learning. \u2026 The market is struggling with this problem and understands the massive competitive advantages of more agility and speed within the data science function,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBy accelerating [the] process via the use of feature stores, we can get more models into production and finally achieve the promise of AI.\u201d"}
