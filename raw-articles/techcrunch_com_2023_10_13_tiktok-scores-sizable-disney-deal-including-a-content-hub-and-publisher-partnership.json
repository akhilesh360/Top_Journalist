The company will join other large publishers, including NBCU, Cond\u00e9 Nast, DotDash Meredith, BuzzFeed and more, which offer brand-safe videos for marketers to place their ads around. The new deal will also see TikTok offering Disney a dedicated destination within the video app where Disney fans can watch videos from Disney\u2019s brands, create their own with Disney\u2019s music and special effects, play Disney-themed trivia, and collect \u201cCharacter Cards\u201d of their favorite players.\n\nThe company describes this content hub as a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind,\u201d suggesting its Disney partnership stretched beyond Premiere Pulse, where it\u2019s now one of the largest Pulse Premiere publishers, to include special accommodations \u2014 and potentially setting the stage for similar large brand partnerships in TikTok\u2019s future.\n\nThe deal came about to help Disney mark The Walt Disney Company\u2019s 100th anniversary, which called for a special celebration across social media. Disney remarked on its decision to work with TikTok \u2014 an app still facing government scrutiny and lawsuits over its ties to China and addictive nature \u2014 noting it had to do with TikTok\u2019s reach. Explained Asad Ayaz, chief brand officer of The Walt Disney Company, in an announcement, Disney\u2019s portfolio of brands and experiences has seen more than 240 billion views on TikTok.\n\n@tiktoknewsroom In honor of @Disney\u2019s 100th anniversary, we\u2019re launching the Disney100 Hub on October 16!

This will include Disney brands highlighting content from Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, ESPN, National Geographic, Disney Parks and more. Those Disney-run TikTok accounts have a total of over 150 million followers, but that number may grow with this event as TikTok notes fans should \u201cexpect daily reminders\u201d of why they connected with \u201cfavorite Disney characters, franchises, movies and Disney memories.\u201d This may also prompt users to create more Disney-related content on the platform.\n\nTo aid with that, Disney and TikTok will also release a Disney100 Playlist for the community which includes popular songs from Disney\u2019s catalog, ranging from classics from movies like \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d to more current songs from \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d and the upcoming movie \u201cWish.\u201d\n\nAs a Pulse Premiere publisher partner, marketers can run ads in brand-safe slots alongside entertainment and sports content from Disney. Though TikTok offers an endless, personalized feed of content for users to scroll through, Pulse Premiere guarantees the ads will run immediately after what TikTok refers to as \u201csuitable videos\u201d from its premium publishing partners. The company had previously partnered with big-name publishes for this offering, including NBCU, Cond\u00e9 Nast, DotDash Meredith, BuzzFeed, Hearst Magazines, Major League Soccer, UFC, Vox Media, and WWE .\n\nBecause of their placement, TikTok said its users are 2.6x more likely to interact with a Pulse ad versus a comparable ad on other video platforms. It also said that Pulse campaigns increased brand recall by +9.8%, on average, and awareness by +6.8%."}
