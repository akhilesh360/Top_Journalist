But this time around, the company is faced with a group of media buyers who are worried about the future of the social network as a \u201cbrand-safe\u201d platform for their marketing efforts. As various reports have noted, some Twitter advertisers have already begun planning how to stop spending on Twitter if Elon Musk\u2019s takeover leads to the service becoming a more toxic and abusive social network.\n\nAdvertisers understand that Musk\u2019s vision of Twitter as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform is one that doesn\u2019t necessarily align with their interests. Brands are historically adverse to having their messages appear next to abusive and divisive speech, hate speech and misinformation. And if Musk were to roll back Twitter\u2019s existing content moderation controls, it could lead to an increase in the sort of content that brands like to avoid becoming more prevalent across Twitter\u2019s platform.\n\nIn recent days, Twitter attempted to assuage advertisers\u2019 fear by writing to ad agencies with assurances that Twitter would remain a safe place for them in the future by separating their ads from any harmful content. But businesses know that Twitter can\u2019t make promises about changes Musk has yet to make. Twitter knows that, too \u2014 in an SEC filing this week, Twitter warned that a loss of ad dollars is one of the risk factors related to the acquisition.\n\nIn previous years, Twitter\u2019s presentation at the NewFronts has previously been a more tepid affair. The company isn\u2019t really thought of in the same space as larger streamers and media companies like Roku, Amazon or NBCU. And it tends to have less to offer than rival social media companies like Snap, Meta and now TikTok \u2014 all of which have already presented this week.\n\nThis time, however, Twitter didn\u2019t just have to pitch its content, it had to convince advertisers it has enough relevant and interesting content to retain them as partners, despite the changes ahead.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

We are committed to investing in our product innovation, and we are committing to increasing the velocity with which we ship products. We\u2019re committed to deepening the relationships with the top rights holders and premium content publishers in the world and also across this country. This is extremely important to us because we know it matters for you to be able to connect your brands with the people that matter to you. So I hope that you have seen this commitment from us tonight,\u201d she said.\n\nTwitter\u2019s content lineup \u2014 which this year included both video and audio deals, thanks to Twitter Spaces \u2014 wasn\u2019t significantly differentiated from the type of deals that are expected for the social network, however.\n\nThe company announced an expansion of a partnership with Cond\u00e9 Nast for live events like Vogue\u2019s Red Carpet at the Met Gala, the Vanity Fair Oscar Party Red Carpet and the Pitchfork Music Festival. It said it will also include other content from Wired, Bon Appetit and The New Yorker, plus highlights, Twitter Moments and multiple Twitter Spaces (audio events) per month.\n\nTwitter is also expanding its partnership with Essence and the WNBA. The former will showcase highlights from events like the Essence Festival of Culture and the Global Black Economic Forum; weekly clips from series like \u201cThe Receipts\u201d and \u201cEssence Uncovered\u201d and monthly Spaces. The WNBA and Twitter are announcing a multiyear extension of their now six-year partnership, which will include 12 live games during the 2022 season. For the first time, the @WNBA account will also host Spaces throughout the season and during WNBA tentpole events and the offseason.\n\nE! News, meanwhile, will launch a new livestreaming show for Twitter called \u201cWhile You Were Streaming,\u201d hosted by Danielle Robay. The show covers popular TV shows like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi,\u201d \u201cThe Real Housewives\u201d and others, where Robay will be joined by a rotating selection of guests, experts and past stars.\n\nTwitter will also newly partner with Revolt to bring music, lifestyle, urban entertainment, sports and social justice content to the platform, including \u201cDrink Champs,\u201d a hip hop podcast; Revolt Summit; \u201cThe Crew League,\u201d where artists compete on the basketball court; financial literacy series \u201cAssets Over Liabilities;\u201d and \u201cRevolt Black News Weekly.\u201d\n\nThe company also said it will be the first social partner to test an integration with NBCU\u2019s cross-platform video-certified measurement partner, iSpot. Advertisers who purchase Amplify sponsorships from NBCUniversal will gain additional insights about the incremental audience generated by their Twitter media campaigns with this deal.\n\nFinally, Twitter said it will launch a pilot program that will bring real-time highlights about global events to the platform. The program will allow advertisers to promote and run pre-roll on live event pages with the highlights, which will allow Twitter users to discover content in their timeline and in the Explore tab.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of advertising is a desire to not just reach consumers but to connect with them around something they care about. Twitter Amplify helps brands get there,\u201d Robin Wheeler, Twitter\u2019s VP and new head of U.S. Client Services, said in a statement shared ahead of the event. \u201cWhen advertisers tap into Twitter\u2019s premium video content, they are aligned with the topics that our uniquely engaged audience is already obsessing over. Premium, brand-safe content that serves diverse communities is more important than ever today. We\u2019re grateful to find new ways to expand this inventory on Twitter, giving our advertisers and marketers a place to drive incremental reach and results\u201d Wheeler added.\n\nPersonette concluded tonight\u2019s presentation with an offer of gratitude to the brands (still?) working with Twitter.\n\n\u201cYour partnership makes us better each and every day. And we are exceptionally grateful for how you stand with us \u2026 ,\u201d she said."}
