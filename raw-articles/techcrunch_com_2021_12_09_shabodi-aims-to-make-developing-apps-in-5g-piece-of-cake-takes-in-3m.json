That\u2019s what makes him excited to support a company like Shabodi.\n\n\u201cApplication developers have always wanted to abstract away network complexities and Shabodi is primed to serve that need,\u201d Ladsariya said via email.\n\nShabodi raised $3.375 million in seed funding to enable enterprises, system integrators and telecommunications companies to accelerate the development and deployment of next-generation applications on 5G.\n\nThe Toronto-based company was founded by telecom veterans Vikram Chopra and Harpreet Geekee in 2020 with an initial focus on 5G deployments through its application enablement platform. This is the pair\u2019s second time working together.\n\nShabodi is already working with customers to leverage the full potential of the network by monetizing their 5G deployments to accelerate return on investment.\n\n\u201c5G is a couple of years away from everyone, but enterprise is ripe for this,\u201d Chopra told TechCrunch. \u201cCompanies are deploying 5G across multiple sites, but building applications on it requires a new skill set, and right now, we are one of the few addressing it.\u201d\n\nLikening it to what Square did for payments, Shabodi aims to demystify 5G by providing simple APIs so that developers can build Industry 4.0 applications without unexpected costs, complexity and domain disparity, he added.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Shabodi raised a $200,000 pre-seed round earlier this year led by Forum Ventures and former Cisco and Yahoo executives.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has 15 employees and two patents, with a third coming next year.\n\nThough Chopra could not reveal other customers, he said that the company is in talks with about a dozen enterprises. He intends to use the new funding to build out product and sales teams as it readies Shabodi\u2019s first product for public consumption by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to partner with Shabodi\u2019s visionary team of industry experts to accelerate the deployment of 5G, one of the most impactful developments of this decade,\u201d said Bruce Taragin, managing director at Blumberg Capital, via email. \u201c5G will disrupt many aspects of enterprise technology, and Shabodi\u2019s platform has the potential to significantly improve how application developers, organizations and entire industries make 5G a reality.\u201d"}
