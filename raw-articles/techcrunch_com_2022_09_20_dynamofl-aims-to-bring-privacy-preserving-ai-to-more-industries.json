Historical data is what \u201cteaches\u201d AI systems to identify patterns and make predictions, but there are technical hurdles to using it without compromising a person\u2019s identity.\n\nOne workaround that\u2019s gained currency in recent years is federated learning. The technique trains a system across multiple devices or servers holding data without ever exchanging it, enabling collaborators to build a common system without sharing data. Intel recently partnered with Penn Medicine to develop a brain tumor\u2013classifying system using federated learning, while a group of major pharma companies, including Novartis and Merck, built a federated learning platform to accelerate drug discovery.\n\nTech giants, including Nvidia (via Clara), offer federated learning as a service. But a new startup, DynamoFL, hopes to take on the incumbents with a federated learning platform that focuses on performance, ostensibly without sacrificing privacy.\n\n\u201cDynamoFL was founded by two MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science PhDs, Christian Lau and myself, who spent the last five years working on privacy-preserving machine learning and hardware for machine learning,\u201d CEO Vaikkunth Mugunthan told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWe discovered an enormous market for federated learning after we received repeated work offers from leading finance and technology companies that were trying to build out federated learning internally in light of emerging privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. During this process, it was clear that these organizations were struggling to stand up federated learning internally and we built DynamoFL to address this gap in the market.\u201d\n\nDynamoFL \u2014 which claims to have key customers in the automotive, internet of things, and finance sectors \u2014 is in the early stages of its go-to-market strategy. (The startup has four employees currently, with plans to hire 10 by the end of the year.) But DynamoFL has focused on refining novel AI techniques to stand out against the competition, offering capabilities that putatively boost system performance while combating attacks and vulnerabilities in federated learning \u2014 like \u201cmember inference\u201d attacks that make it possible to detect the data used to train a system.\n\n\u201cOur personalized federated learning technology \u2026 enable[s] machine learning teams to fine-tune their models to improve performance on individual cohorts. This gives C-suite executives higher confidence when deploying machine learning models that were previously considered black-box solutions,\u201d Mugunthan said. \u201cThis [also] differentiates us from competitors like Devron, Rhino Health, Owkin, NimbleEdge and FedML that struggle with the common challenges of traditional federated learning.\u201d\n\nDynamoFL also advertises its platform as cost-efficient pitted against other privacy-preserving AI point solutions. Since federated learning doesn\u2019t necessitate the mass collection of data on a central server, DynamoFL can cut data transfer and computation costs, Mugunthan asserts \u2014 for example, allowing a customer to send only small, incremental files rather than petabytes of raw data. As an added benefit, this can reduce the risk of data leaks by eliminating the need to store large volumes of data on a single server.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This critical bottleneck challenge has prevented many machine learning teams from adopting privacy-preserving machine learning technologies that are needed to safeguard user privacy while complying with regulatory frameworks,\u201d Mugunthan said. \u201cDynamoFL\u2019s personalized federated learning solution tackles a critical hurdle to machine learning adoption.\u201d\n\nRecently, DynamoFL closed a small seed round ($4.15 million at a $35 million valuation) that had participation from Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital and Basis Set; the startup is a part of Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2022 batch. Mugunthan says that the proceeds will mainly be put toward recruiting product managers who can integrate DynamoFL\u2019s technologies into future, user-friendly products.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapidly leveraging diverse data for emerging crises in healthcare. In particular, the pandemic underscored how critical medical data needs to be made more accessible during times of crisis, while still protecting patient privacy,\u201d Mugunthan continued. \u201cWe are well-positioned to weather the slowdown in tech. We currently have three to four years of runway, and the tech slowdown has actually assisted our hiring efforts. The largest tech companies were hiring the majority of leading federated learning scientists, so the slowdown in hiring in big tech has presented an opportunity for us to hire top federated learning and machine learning talent.\u201d"}
