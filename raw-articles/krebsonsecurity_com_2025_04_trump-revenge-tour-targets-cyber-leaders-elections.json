The White House memo, which also suspended clearances for other security professionals at Krebs\u2019s employer SentinelOne, comes as CISA is facing huge funding and staffing cuts.\n\nThe extraordinary April 9 memo directs the attorney general to investigate Chris Krebs (no relation), calling him \u201ca significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government authority.\u201d\n\nThe memo said the inquiry will include \u201ca comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA\u2019s activities over the last 6 years and will identify any instances where Krebs\u2019 or CISA\u2019s conduct appears to be contrary to the administration\u2019s commitment to free speech and ending federal censorship, including whether Krebs\u2019 conduct was contrary to suitability standards for federal employees or involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information.\u201d\n\nCISA was created in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term, with Krebs installed as its first director. In 2020, CISA launched Rumor Control, a website that sought to rebut disinformation swirling around the 2020 election.\n\nThat effort ran directly counter to Trump\u2019s claims that he lost the election because it was somehow hacked and stolen. The Trump campaign and its supporters filed at least 62 lawsuits contesting the election, vote counting, and vote certification in nine states, and nearly all of those cases were dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence or standing.\n\nWhen the Justice Department began prosecuting people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, President Trump and Republican leaders shifted the narrative, claiming that Trump lost the election because the previous administration had censored conservative voices on social media.\n\nIncredibly, the president\u2019s memo seeking to ostracize Krebs stands reality on its head, accusing Krebs of promoting the censorship of election information, \u201cincluding known risks associated with certain voting practices.\u201d Trump also alleged that Krebs \u201cfalsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines\u201d [emphasis added].\n\nKrebs did not respond to a request for comment. SentinelOne issued a statement saying it would cooperate in any review of security clearances held by its personnel, which is currently fewer than 10 employees.\n\nKrebs\u2019s former agency is now facing steep budget and staff reductions. The Record reports that CISA is looking to remove some 1,300 people by cutting about half its full-time staff and another 40% of its contractors.\n\n\u201cThe agency\u2019s National Risk Management Center, which serves as a hub analyzing risks to cyber and critical infrastructure, is expected to see significant cuts, said two sources familiar with the plans,\u201d The Record\u2019s Suzanne Smalley wrote. \u201cSome of the office\u2019s systematic risk responsibilities will potentially be moved to the agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Division, according to one of the sources.\u201d\n\nCNN reports the Trump administration is also advancing plans to strip civil service protections from 80% of the remaining CISA employees, potentially allowing them to be fired for political reasons.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) urged professionals in the cybersecurity community to defend Krebs and SentinelOne, noting that other security companies and professionals could be the next victims of Trump\u2019s efforts to politicize cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cThe White House must not be given free reign to turn cybersecurity professionals into political scapegoats,\u201d the EFF wrote. \u201cIt is critical that the cybersecurity community now join together to denounce this chilling attack on free speech and rally behind Krebs and SentinelOne rather than cowering because they fear they will be next.\u201d\n\nHowever, Reuters said it found little sign of industry support for Krebs or SentinelOne, and that many security professionals are concerned about potentially being targeted if they speak out.\n\n\u201cReuters contacted 33 of the largest U.S. cybersecurity companies, including tech companies and professional services firms with large cybersecurity practices, and three industry groups, for comment on Trump\u2019s action against SentinelOne,\u201d wrote Raphael Satter and A.J. Vicens. \u201cOnly one offered comment on Trump\u2019s action. The rest declined, did not respond or did not answer questions.\u201d\n\nCYBERCOM-PLICATIONS\n\nOn April 3, President Trump fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the U.S. Cyber Command, as well as Haugh\u2019s deputy, Wendy Noble. The president did so immediately after meeting in the Oval Office with far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who reportedly urged their dismissal. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One after news of the firings broke, Trump questioned Haugh\u2019s loyalty.\n\nVirginia Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it inexplicable that the administration would remove the senior leaders of NSA-CYBERCOM without cause or warning, and risk disrupting critical ongoing intelligence operations.\n\n\u201cIt is astonishing, too, that President Trump would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the National Security Agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app \u2013 even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office,\u201d Warner said in a statement.\n\nOn Feb. 28, The Record\u2019s Martin Matishak cited three sources saying Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered U.S. Cyber Command to stand down from all planning against Russia, including offensive digital actions. The following day, The Guardian reported that analysts at CISA were verbally informed that they were not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.\n\nA follow-up story from The Washington Post cited officials saying Cyber Command had received an order to halt active operations against Russia, but that the pause was intended to last only as long as negotiations with Russia continue.\n\nThe Department of Defense responded on Twitter/X that Hegseth had \u201cneither canceled nor delayed any cyber operations directed against malicious Russian targets and there has been no stand-down order whatsoever from that priority.\u201d\n\nBut on March 19, Reuters reported several U.S. national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cRegular meetings between the National Security Council and European national security officials have gone unscheduled, and the NSC has also stopped formally coordinating efforts across U.S. agencies, including with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department,\u201d Reuters reported, citing current and former officials.\n\nTARIFFS VS TYPHOONS\n\nPresident\u2019s Trump\u2019s institution of 125% tariffs on goods from China has seen Beijing strike back with 84 percent tariffs on U.S. imports. Now, some security experts are warning that the trade war could spill over into a cyber conflict, given China\u2019s successful efforts to burrow into America\u2019s critical infrastructure networks.\n\nOver the past year, a number of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions have come into focus, including a sprawling espionage campaign involving the compromise of at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers. Dubbed \u201cSalt Typhoon\u201d by Microsoft, these telecom intrusions were pervasive enough that CISA and the FBI in December 2024 warned Americans against communicating sensitive information over phone networks, urging people instead to use encrypted messaging apps (like Signal).\n\nThe other broad ranging China-backed campaign is known as \u201cVolt Typhoon,\u201d which CISA described as \u201cstate-sponsored cyber actors seeking to pre-position themselves on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States.\u201d\n\nResponsibility for determining the root causes of the Salt Typhoon security debacle fell to the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in February 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events. But on his first full day back in the White House, President Trump dismissed all 15 CSRB advisory committee members \u2014 likely because those advisers included Chris Krebs.\n\nLast week, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) placed a hold on Trump\u2019s nominee to lead CISA, saying the hold would continue unless the agency published a report on the telecom industry hacks, as promised."}
