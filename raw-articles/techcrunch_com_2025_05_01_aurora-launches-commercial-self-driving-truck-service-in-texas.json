The debut also comes five months after rival Kodiak Robotics delivered its first autonomous trucks to a commercial customer for driverless operations in off-road environments.\n\nAurora says it began running freight this week between Dallas and Houston with its launch customers Hirschbach Motor Lines and Uber Freight, and that it has completed 1,200 miles in a single self-driving truck without a driver so far. The company plans to build up to \u201ctens of self-driving trucks\u201d and expand to El Paso and Phoenix by the end of 2025.\n\nAurora will also continue to haul \u201cmore than 100 loads of commercial freight\u201d for customers every week with a fleet of more than 30 supervised autonomous trucks, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nAurora\u2019s plan is to start its driverless trucking operations by owning, maintaining, and insuring its own trucks for customers. The company is working with its strategic partners Volvo Trucks and Paccar to develop self-driving trucks for high-volume manufacturing. Aurora expects its customers to buy those trucks directly from manufacturers starting in 2027 or earlier.\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to learn whether the system has needed to implement a pullover maneuver or required remote human assistance, though CEO Chris Urmson said in a statement that the Aurora Driver \u201cperformed perfectly\u201d during his inaugural trip.\n\nAurora\u2019s commercial launch comes at a challenging time. Self-driving truck companies have long pitched the necessity of their technology due to labor shortages in long-haul trucking and an expected growth in freight shipping. Trump\u2019s tariffs have changed that outlook, at least in the short term. According to an April report from commercial vehicle industry analysis firm ACT Research, freight is expected to decrease in the U.S. this year as volumes and consumer spending decline.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

TechCrunch has reached out to learn more about how tariffs affect Aurora\u2019s business.\n\nFor now, Aurora will likely focus on continuing to prove its safety case without a driver, and work with state and federal legislators to adopt favorable policies to help it expand.\n\nAt the start of 2025, Aurora brought a suit against federal safety regulators after a court denied its request to be exempt from a safety requirement that involves placing warning triangles on the road when a truck needs to pull over on the highway \u2014 something that is difficult to do when there\u2019s no driver in the vehicle.\n\nIn order to remain in compliance with that rule and still deploy a fully driverless service, it would make sense for Aurora to have a human-driven car trail its trucks whenever they\u2019re in operation.\n\nRachel Chibidakis, an Aurora spokesperson, said the company did not require lead vehicles, chase vehicles, or police escorts for its driverless operations.\n\n\u201cIn addition to our driverless trucks, we have supervised autonomous trucks that are delivering goods for customers everyday between Dallas and Houston,\u201d Chibidakis said. \u201cIn the rare case a driverless truck encounters an issue and needs to pull over to the side of the road, a vehicle with vehicle operators won\u2019t be far away.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with more information and comments from an Aurora spokesperson."}
