For nearly 10 years, this was the home of the former Facebook\u2019s experimental internet and telecoms efforts, from satellites (exploded) to drones (crashed) to apps (disputed) and other more traditional infrastructure (appreciated and ongoing).\n\nAs first noted by Light Reading, Meta Connectivity\u2019s staff and projects, or what remain of them after the imminent cuts, will be divided between its Infrastructure and Central Products divisions. Exactly which resources and people will stay is no doubt a matter of some discussion even now, but the complete reduction of Connectivity suggests the more out-there approaches to providing internet are probably gone for good.\n\nThe beginning of this division can probably be traced to attempts about ten years ago to subsidize internet connections in developing countries and regions. The Internet.org and Free Basics efforts would essentially provide Facebook and some bundled services free of charge to places where connectivity was expensive.\n\nThis provoked a great deal of controversy at the time, from people incensed that a U.S. company thought it should step in to solve another\u2019s problems, to the notion that the same company would essentially control access and content in violation of net neutrality policies, to others who saw the ostensibly charitable endeavor as Facebook buying global market share.\n\nIn 2015 the company revealed plans for a completely unexpected high-altitude drone named Aquila, which would use lasers to connect people below it. This ambitious effort had a tough couple years, experiencing a rough landing in 2016 and eventually being permanently grounded in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, they were going even higher than that with an early attempt at a low Earth orbit satellite connectivity system, which was scheduled for launch in September 2016.

I reached out to check in but haven\u2019t heard back. (Update: Looks like the satellite division was sold off to Amazon in 2021. That explains it\u2026)\n\nBut not everything the Connectivity division did flew in the air. As they probably had reiterated to them every time they talked about drones and lasers, what\u2019s really needed is fiber backhaul and solid traditional wireless infrastructure so that neglected areas can connect just like everyone else in the world does.\n\nTo that end, Meta has been working with the Telecom Infra Project to build new software, hardware and standards that make telecommunications networks more accessible and maintainable. Legacy industry dominates this space, so new entrants have a potentially large opportunity to make a change. Meta and Google, for instance, have invested in undersea cables and fiber that serve both their own purposes and public transport.\n\nThat said, now that Connectivity is being broken up for parts, it\u2019s impossible to say which efforts will continue to be pursued, funded, and so on. We\u2019ll keep an eye out when the layoffs and consolidation conclude and see what\u2019s left standing."}
