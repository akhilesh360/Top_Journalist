Envisics didn\u2019t share an updated valuation with the closing of its Series C, but the startup did bring on new investors like M&G Investments.\n\nThe previous $50 million round was led by Hyundai Mobis, with participation from InMotion Ventures (the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover) and Stellantis.\n\nThe closing of its Series C comes as Envisics gets nearer to commercializing its augmented reality heads-up display (AR HUD). General Motors has confirmed that Envisics\u2019 second-generation displays will be available in the electric Cadillac Lyriq, but could not be reached in time to provide a timeline or additional details.\n\nDr. Jamieson Christmas, founder and CEO of Envisics, told TechCrunch in March that its first HUDs with GM are \u201cremarkably, absolutely on track to be released this year.\u201d\n\nChristmas also said that Envisics is \u201cworking with just about everybody\u201d at the moment, but didn\u2019t name names beyond JLR (formerly Jaguar Land Rover) and GM. However, given the startup\u2019s backers, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll begin to see automakers like Stellantis, Hyundai and SAIC Motor start announcing similar tech.\n\nAside from automakers, Envisics has also partnered with Panasonic Automotive Systems, a major automotive supplier under consumer electronics giant Panasonic, which suggests rollouts across a wider range of vehicles at various price points in the future.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Typically, navigation data and vehicle information can be seen on LED display screens, which are placed above a vehicle\u2019s center console. But engaging with those displays requires the driver to take their eyes off the road, which could be a safety hazard.\n\nFor its part, BMW has unveiled two concept cars \u2014 Dee and Vision Neue Klasse \u2014 that both feature AR HUDs. The automaker didn\u2019t say with which AR company it would work to power its HUDs, but in the past, BMW has partnered with Finnish company Basemark to bring the tech into BMW iX models.\n\nThe adoption of AR HUDs come as automakers also press ahead to advance advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and other forms of autonomous driving \u2014 see Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d beta advanced driver assistance system (ADAS); Polestar\u2019s use of Mobileye\u2019s hands-off, eyes-off ADAS; and XPeng\u2019s XNGP."}
