And so we think it makes it a lot easier to be exchanged, a lot more accessible for everybody.\u201d\n\nRobinhood's Johann Kerbrat at Consensus 2025.

Others include BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Apollo, and VanEck.\n\nRWA tokenization is often touted as a means to enhance financial accessibility, with most tokenized funds currently concentrated on the private credit and US treasury markets. According to RWA.xyz on May 16, the total market capitalization of onchain RWA is $22.5 billion across just 101,457 asset holders. On average, each holder owns $221,867 in onchain assets.\n\nRelated: MultiBank, MAG, Mavryk ink world\u2019s largest $3B RWA tokenization deal\n\nStablecoin evolution will create more \u2018specialized\u2019 tokens\n\nKerbrat also touched on stablecoins, which have emerged as a key crypto use case this cycle. \u201cYou will see 100 stablecoins,\u201d he predicted.\n\nKerbrat expects a rise in stablecoins that are \u201cmore specialized in a specific market.\u201d According to DefiLlama, dollar-pegged stablecoins dominate the stablecoin sector.
