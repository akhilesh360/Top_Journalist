But when you need something at the nanometer scale, DNA is a better bet \u2014 but who has the time to design and assemble it base by base? New research lets would-be DNA origami masters design the shape \u2014 while an algorithm determines where to put our friends A, T, G, and C.\n\nDNA\u2019s structure doesn\u2019t have to be just a double helix: by fiddling with the order of bases or substituting other molecules, the strand can be cause to make a hard right turn, or curve around in one direction or another \u2014 and with enough foresight, a single strand can make enough twists and convolutions that it forms a useful geometric structure.\n\nThese structures can be used to deliver drugs, encapsulate tools like CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing elements, or even store information.\n\nThe problem has been that designing, say, a dodecahedron is a tremendously complicated task, and few have the expertise to assemble such a complex molecule, composed of thousands of base pairs, by hand. That\u2019s what researchers at MIT, Arizona State University, and Baylor University aimed to change, and their success is detailed today in the journal Science.\n\n\u201cThe paper turns the problem around from one in which an expert designs the DNA needed to synthesize the object, to one in which the object itself is the starting point, with the DNA sequences that are needed automatically defined by the algorithm,\u201d said MIT\u2019s Mark Bathe in a press release.\n\nBasically, all the user needs to do is provide a 3D shape with a closed surface. It could be a polyhedron, something more round, like a torus, or less symmetrical, like a teardrop. As long as it is designed within certain specifications, once you hand it off to the computer, your work is done.\n\nThe algorithm created by the researchers determines the exact order of bases needed to provide the \u201cscaffold,\u201d the single strand of DNA that will bend and twist around itself to produce the shape. It even has a cool name: DAEDALUS. (DNA Origami Sequence Design Algorithm for User-defined Structures \u2014 not an exact match, but we\u2019ll forgive them.)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

A unique structure could be created using the algorithm, with portions dedicated to encoded binary data \u2014 basically it would be a nanoscale ROM disk made of DNA. How cool is that?\n\n\u201cOur hope is that this automation significantly broadens participation of others in the use of this powerful molecular design paradigm,\u201d said Bathe."}
