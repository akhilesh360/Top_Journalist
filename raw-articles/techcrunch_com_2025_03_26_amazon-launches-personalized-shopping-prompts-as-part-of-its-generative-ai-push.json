The company announced on Wednesday a new feature called \u201cInterests,\u201d aimed at creating a more personalized and conversational search experience.\n\nWith the new feature, customers can enter tailored prompts in the search bar, reflecting their interests, preferences, and even their budget. For example, users might ask for \u201cmodel building kits and accessories for hobbyist engineers\u201d or \u201cbrewing tools and gadgets for coffee lovers.\u201d\n\nInterests leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert everyday language into queries that traditional search engines can understand, resulting in more relevant product suggestions.\n\nAdditionally, the tool continuously works in the background, notifying users when new items that match their interests become available, as well as providing updates on relevant products, restocks, and deals.\n\nCurrently, Interests is available to a select group of users in the U.S. via the Amazon Shopping app on iOS and Android devices, as well as on the mobile website under the \u201cMe\u201d tab.\n\nThe company plans to expand access to more U.S. customers in the coming months.\n\nThe Interests feature represents a natural progression for the tech giant as it continues to integrate AI into its app. The feature joins a host of AI-powered features already on Amazon, including its AI shopping assistant Rufus, AI Shopping Guides, review summaries, AI-generated product information, and more.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It also launched an AI summary tool to provide product information."}
