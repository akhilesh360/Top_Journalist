The company says that it raised almost $50 million to \u201cextract lithium from previously inaccessible reserves.\u201d That makes sense: Lithium is a valuable, hard-to-get resource that is being used by the bucketload in batteries and other electronics. But the pitch deck relegates this use case (which is the smallest opportunity in the deck) almost to footnote status.\n\nIt makes for some really interesting reading and storytelling, so let\u2019s dive in and see if we can spot what happened and how.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here\u2019s how you can do that.\n\nSlides in this deck\n\nCover slide Mission statement slide Vision slide Solution slide 1 Solution slide 2 Product slide Value proposition slide Potential use cases slide Technology challenges slide Competitive advantage slide Traction slide Results slide Go-to-market strategy slide Technology advantage slide Scaling slide Target markets slide Product lines overview slide Product line 1 slide Product line 2 slide Product line 3 slide Summary slide Ask and use of funds slide Thank you slide\n\nThree things to love\n\nI\u2019ll be honest here: I don\u2019t really understand what the company does. Perhaps I\u2019m just not deep tech enough to fully appreciate how biotech works. On the other hand, I\u2019m firmly of the opinion that if you can\u2019t explain your business to a five-year-old, there\u2019s something wrong with your storytelling.\n\nStill, Aether did get a few things right.\n\nA bold setup\n\nStraight out of the gate on slide 2, the company plants the seed for a huge vision:\n\n[Slide 2] Setting up a bold vision for the future. Image Credits: Aether Bio\n\nIf there\u2019s anything you could put on a slide to catch my attention, this would be pretty high on the list. Yes, I do want to imagine that future. There\u2019s a risk here, of course: Is the company going to be able to fulfill the promise it makes?\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

On face value, however, this slide is impressive:\n\n[Slide 7] If true, I wouldn\u2019t want to be Aether\u2019s competitors. Image Credits: Aether Bio\n\nAny company that can genuinely show it is 20x faster and 1/10th of the price per sample, and 1/50th of the initial investment of existing technology is flashing a huge, neon \u201cdisrupting the industry\u201d sign alongside its pitch. Again, I\u2019d want to verify the claims, but this will absolutely capture my attention.\n\nAddressing the challenges head-on\n\nThe little I do know about companies in this space is that there are tremendous challenges involved with bringing synthetic bioproducts to market. It\u2019s refreshing to see Aether address some of those challenges head-on.\n\n[Slide 13] \u201cYeah, we know this is hard, but here\u2019s how we are mitigating the issues.\u201d Image Credits: Aether Bio\n\nFrom this slide, you can learn how to tackle some of the reasons VCs may have been burned in the past in this space, and explain how you are different.\n\nThis is similar to how companies building in the medtech microfluidics space put \u201cHere is how we are different from Theranos\u201d in an appendix slide. It\u2019s tongue-in-cheek, but you know the question is going to come up, so you may as well be prepared for it. Elegantly done!\n\nIn the rest of this teardown, we\u2019ll look at three things Aether could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!\n\nThree things that could be improved\n\nThe biggest improvement, I think, could be done on the storytelling front.\n\nExplain it like I\u2019m 5\n\nThere\u2019s an entire subreddit dedicated to explaining complex topics as if the person asking the question were a 5-year-old, and I think this deck could benefit from taking a similar approach. I don\u2019t mean you have to speak down to your investors, but you also don\u2019t have to technobabble your way through your pitch.\n\nThis pitch deck is exceedingly vague and I think it could have been brought to life with examples. A good framework for that would be \u201cUnlike [current solution], which [problem with current solution], we do [solution] so that [target customer] can [value proposition].\u201d\n\nSuch an approach forces you to think about the whole problem space in a way that is understandable to investors.\n\n[Slide 18] This slide (and the three that follow it) are pretty deep tech, and hard to understand and get excited about. Image Credits: Aether\n\nAether could have rephrased this whole argument thus: \u201cToxic water is increasingly a problem because polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) cannot economically be filtered out of our drinking water using existing means. So, we have developed a protein that can get rid of the PFAS in water at 1,000th of the cost. We suspect this method will become mandatory in all drinking supplies within the next 10 years, representing a $45 billion opportunity.\u201d\n\nRemember that you\u2019re not just trying to convince the investors in the meeting. Your investors also have to get the rest of the partnership on board with the investment at hand. It\u2019s just a good idea to give them the tools to show their friends, co-investors and the rest of the partnership exactly why they are so excited about your company.\n\nThat\u2019s the worst \u201cuse of funds\u201d I\u2019ve seen in years\n\n[Slide 22] Give us money and I guess I\u2019ll do some stuff. Image Credits: Aether\n\nWe\u2019re going to build out a product line, prototype our tech and hire more executives. Really? You could copy and paste those three \u201cuse of funds\u201d statements into any one of the previous 70 Pitch Deck Teardowns and get away scot-free. That\u2019s some next-level vagueness.\n\nAether raised almost $50 million, so they clearly got by with this slide. But as a startup, you can do better. Spell out what milestones you\u2019re planning to hit, where and how you are planning to invest the capital, and what the company will look like in 18 months. An operating plan wouldn\u2019t have been amiss.\n\nSome images and illustrations, maybe?\n\nThe deck is extremely vague in a lot of ways that sets off alarm bells.\n\nThe cover slide has the only photo in the entire deck. And when I went to check if the team slide had any pictures, I realized there was no team slide, so forgive me \u2014 screw the illustrations, I found a far more serious mistake:\n\nWhere\u2019s your team?!\n\nIf you\u2019re going to build a company that is doing something right at the bleeding edge of technology, you\u2019re going to need an extraordinary team. You need strong leadership (to set the direction), good science folks (to tell the leadership if this is even possible), excellent salespeople (to sell the brand-new thing) and technical and operations teams (to make things work in the first place, and then to make it work at scale).\n\nThe overall snake-oily vagueness, combined with the lack of a team slide sets off some pretty spicy-colored flags for me. For a deep tech company to work, you need a hell of a team. A lot of the conversation will be around how you\u2019ve got the best team to execute against the mission, and what your pipeline is for hiring the best of the best going forward.\n\nThis deck explains none of those things, which likely means one of three things:\n\nThe founders are bad and don\u2019t have a good plan for hiring. The founders are so good that they don\u2019t even really need this pitch deck to raise money. The founders don\u2019t understand why this is an important part of the narrative, which, honestly, would also be a pretty big red flag.\n\nTeam slides. They are mandatory. No discussion.\n\nThe full pitch deck\n\nIf you want your own pitch deck teardown featured on TC+, here\u2019s more information.
