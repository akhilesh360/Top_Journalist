Automakers must now test any upgrades or new features in ADAS and receive government approval before rolling it out via software update.\n\nWireless software updates that improve or fix features in vehicles \u2014 and first popularized by Tesla \u2014 have become a critical capability for automakers trying to stay competitive.\n\nThe mandate stems from growing concerns over vehicle safety and incidents of fatal crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems. Last month, a Xiaomi Su7 sedan caught fire after crashing into a pole just seconds after the driver took over control from the ADAS.\n\nIt also follows Tesla\u2019s rollout of its \u201cFull Self-Driving software\u201d branding used for its advanced driver-assistance system. FSD is not a self-driving system and requires a human driver to remain engaged. In China, Tesla changed the FSD name to \u201cIntelligent Assisted Driving.\u201d"}
