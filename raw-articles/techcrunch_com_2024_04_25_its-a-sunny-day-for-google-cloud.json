That continues a positive trend for the division, which in the previous quarter (Q4 2023) notched year-on-year growth of 25.66%.\n\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s operating income grew nearly 5x to $900 million, up from $191 million. No doubt investors were pleased about this tidbit, along with Alphabet\u2019s first-ever dividend (of 20 cents per share) and a $70 billion share repurchase program.\n\nElsewhere across Alphabet, Google Search and other revenue climbed 14.4% to $46.15 billion in the first fiscal quarter. YouTube revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $8.09 billion (a slight dip from Q4 2023 revenue of $9.2 billion), and Google\u2019s overall advertising business gained 13% year-on-year to reach $61.6 billion.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets category, which includes the company\u2019s self-driving vehicle subsidiary Waymo, was the notable loser. Revenue grew 72% to $495 million in Q1, but Other Bets lost $1.02 billion \u2014 about the same as it lost in Q4 2023. (Other Bets typically isn\u2019t profitable.)\n\nAlphabet\u2019s whole-org revenue stands at $80.5 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, with net income coming in at $23.7 billion (up 57%). Beyond Google Cloud\u2019s performance, a reduced headcount might\u2019ve contributed to the winning quarter; Alphabet reported a 5% drop in workforce to 180,895 employees.\n\nOn a call with investors, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that YouTube\u2019s and Google\u2019s cloud businesses are projected to reach a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by the end of 2024. Last year, the divisions\u2019 combined revenue was $64.59 billion, with Google Cloud raking in $33.08 billion and YouTube generating $31.51 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
