Over time, it has introduced the program to various regions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\n\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\n\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\n\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\n\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\n\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
