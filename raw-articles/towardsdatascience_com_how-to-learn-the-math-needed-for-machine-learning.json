Research Scientist \u2014 A full-time researcher on cutting edge models.\n\nA full-time researcher on cutting edge models. Applied Research Scientist \u2014 Somewhere between research and industry.\n\nYou will particularly need strong maths skills.\n\nIt also depends on what company you work for. If you are a machine learning engineer or data scientist or any tech role at:\n\nDeepmind\n\nMicrosoft AI\n\nMeta Research\n\nGoogle Research\n\nYou will also need strong maths skills because you are working in a research lab, akin to a university or college research lab.\n\nIn fact, most machine learning and AI research is done at large corporations rather than universities due to the financial costs of running models on massive data, which can be millions of pounds.\n\nFor these roles and positions I have mentioned, your maths skills will need to be a minimum of a bachelor\u2019s degree in a subject such as math, physics, computer science, statistics, or engineering.\n\nHowever, ideally, you will have a master\u2019s or PhD in one of those subjects, as these degrees teach the research skills needed for these research-based roles or companies.\n\nThis may sound heartening to some of you, but this is just the truth from the statistics.\n\nAccording to a notebook from the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey, the research scientist role is highly popular among PhD and doctorates.\n\nAnd in general, the higher your education the more money you will earn, which will correlate with maths knowledge.\n\nHowever, if you want to work in the industry on production projects, the math skills needed are considerably less. Many people I know working as machine learning engineers and data scientists don\u2019t have a \u201ctarget\u201d background.\n\nThis is because industry is not so \u201cresearch\u201d intensive. It\u2019s often about determining the optimal business strategy or decision and then implementing that into a machine-learning model.\n\nSometimes, a simple decision engine is only required, and machine learning would be overkill.\n\nHigh school maths knowledge is usually sufficient for these roles. Still, you may need to brush up on key areas, particularly for interviews or specific specialisms like reinforcement learning or time series, which are quite maths-intensive.\n\nTo be honest, the majority of roles are in industry, so the maths skills needed for most people will not be at the PhD or master\u2019s level.\n\nBut I would be lying if I said these qualifications do not give you an advantage.\n\nWhat maths do you need to know?\n\nThere are three core areas you need to know:\n\nStatistics\n\nCalculus\n\nLinear Algebra\n\nStatistics\n\nI may be slightly biased, but statistics is the most important area you should know and put the most effort into understanding.\n\nMost machine learning originated from statistical learning theory, so learning statistics will mean you will inherently learn machine learning or its basics.\n\nThese are the areas you should study:\n\nDescriptive Statistics \u2014 This is useful for general analysis and diagnosing your models. This is all about summarising and portraying your data in the best way. Averages: Mean, Median, Mode Spread: Standard Deviation, Variance, Covariance Plots: Bar, Line, Pie, Histograms, Error Bars\n\n\u2014 This is useful for general analysis and diagnosing your models. This is all about summarising and portraying your data in the best way. Probability Distributions \u2014 This is the heart of statistics as it defines the shape of the probability of events. There are many, and I mean many, distributions, but you certainly don\u2019t need to learn all of them. Normal Binomial Gamma Log-normal Poisson Geometric\n\n\u2014 This is the heart of statistics as it defines the shape of the probability of events. There are many, and I mean many, distributions, but you certainly don\u2019t need to learn all of them. Probability Theory \u2014 As I said earlier, machine learning is based on statistical learning, which comes from understanding how probability works. The most important concepts are Maximum likelihood estimation Central limit theorem Bayesian statistics\n\n\u2014 As I said earlier, machine learning is based on statistical learning, which comes from understanding how probability works. The most important concepts are Hypothesis Testing \u2014Most real-world use cases of data and machine learning revolve around testing. You will test your models in production or carry out an A/B test for your customers; therefore, understanding how to run hypothesis tests is very important. Significance Level Z-Test T-Test Chi-Square Test Sampling\n\n\u2014Most real-world use cases of data and machine learning revolve around testing. You will test your models in production or carry out an A/B test for your customers; therefore, understanding how to run hypothesis tests is very important. Modelling & Inference \u2014Models like linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, and any regression algorithm originally came from statistics, not machine learning. Linear Regression Logistic Regression Polynomial Regression Model Residuals Model Uncertainty Generalised Linear Models\n\n\u2014Models like linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, and any regression algorithm originally came from statistics, not machine learning.\n\nCalculus\n\nMost machine learning algorithms learn from gradient descent in one way or another. And, gradient descent has its roots in calculus.\n\nThere are two main areas in calculus you should cover:\n\nDifferentiation\n\nWhat is a derivative?\n\nDerivatives of common functions.\n\nTurning point, maxima, minima and saddle points.\n\nPartial derivatives and multivariable calculus.\n\nChain and product rules.\n\nConvex vs non-convex differentiable functions.\n\nIntegration\n\nWhat is integration?\n\nIntegration by parts and substitution.\n\nThe integral of common functions.\n\nIntegration of areas and volumes.\n\nLinear Algebra\n\nLinear algebra is used everywhere in machine learning, and a lot in deep learning. Most models represent data and features as matrices and vectors.\n\nVectors What are vectors Magnitude, direction Dot product Vector product Vector operations (addition, subtraction, etc)\n\nMatrices What is a matrix Trace Inverse Transpose Determinants Dot product Matrix decomposition\n\nEigenvalues & Eigenvectors Finding eigenvectors Eigenvalue decomposition Spectrum analysis\n\n\n\nBest Resources\n\nThere are loads of resources, and it really comes down to your learning style.\n\nIf you are after textbooks, then you can\u2019t go wrong with the following and is pretty much all you need:\n\nPractical Statistics For Data Scientist \u2014 I recommend this book all the time and for good reason. This is the only textbook you realistically need to learn the statistics for Data Science and machine learning.\n\n\u2014 I recommend this book all the time and for good reason. This is the only textbook you realistically need to learn the statistics for Data Science and machine learning. Mathematics for Machine Learning \u2014 As the name implies, this textbook will teach the maths for machine learning. A lot of the information in this book may be overkill, but your maths skills will be excellent if you study everything.\n\nIf you want some online courses, I have heard good things about the following ones.\n\nMathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialisation \u2014 This course is by DeepLearning.AI, the same people who made the Machine Learning Specialisation, arguably the best machine learning course.\n\nLearning Advice\n\nThe amount of maths content you need to learn may seem overwhelming, but don\u2019t worry.\n\nThe main thing is to break it down step by step.\n\nPick one of the three: statistics, Linear Algebra or calculus.\n\nLook at the things I wrote above you need to know and choose one resource. It doesn\u2019t have to be any of the ones I recommended above.\n\nThat\u2019s the initial work done. Don\u2019t overcomplicate by looking for the \u201cbest resource\u201d because such a thing doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nNow, start working through the resources, but don\u2019t just blindly read or watch the videos.\n\nActively take notes and document your understanding. I personally write blog posts, which essentially employ the Feynman technique, as I am, in a way, \u201cteaching\u201d others what I know.\n\nWriting blogs may be too much for some people, so just make sure you have good notes, either physically or digitally, that are in your own words and that you can reference later.\n\nThe learning process is generally quite simple, and there have been studies done on how to do it effectively. The general gist is:\n\nDo a little bit every day\n\nReview old concepts frequently (spaced repetition)\n\nDocument your learning\n\nIt\u2019s all about the process; follow it, and you will learn!\n\nAnother Thing!\n\nJoin my free newsletter, Dishing the Data, where I share weekly tips, insights, and advice from my experience as a practicing Machine Learning engineer.
