Last week the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the consortium behind Matter, officially approved the first set of specifications so developers can apply for certification for their solutions.\n\nSamsung said it\u2019s using Matter\u2019s multi-admin capabilities to make compatible devices easy to find and control across different apps. Once the company updates the SmartThings apps, users can see Matter-enabled devices that were set up under Google\u2019s ecosystem and then import them into Samsung\u2019s ecosystem and vice versa. This way, users will be able to control these devices from either the Samsung SmartThings app or the Google Home app.\n\n\u201cAs the largest Android developer, Samsung values its strong partnership with Google. Providing users with greater flexibility through this new multi-admin feature is a natural progression in our evolution as partners, allowing us to better support our massive existing and potential user base with both Samsung and Google products,\u201d Jaeyeon Jung, Corporate VP and head of SmartThings at Samsung said in a statement."}
