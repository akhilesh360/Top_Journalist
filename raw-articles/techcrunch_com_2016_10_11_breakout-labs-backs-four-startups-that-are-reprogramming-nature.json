If a startup\u2019s research and development does not lead to commercialization as hoped, Breakout Labs does not seek any money back, and counts the cash it has invested as a grant.\n\nIf a company succeeds enough to go on to raise outside venture capital, Breakout Labs\u2019 earlier grant is exchanged for shares at a cost discount.\n\nAnd if Breakout Labs companies are acquired or go public, generating returns for investors, the fund puts all of its returns into future grants for other advanced tech and science startups. Fishburne calls this approach \u201cfirst mile,\u201d funding.\n\nBreakout Labs also pays for startup founders it has newly backed to travel to San Francisco for quarterly meetings with one another, and for its annual \u201cUnboxing day,\u201d where founders can show off their research, and network with potential strategic partners and venture investors.\n\nFishburne said if there\u2019s one unifying theme among the companies it has backed to-date, it\u2019s the idea of \u201creprogramming\u201d nature. \u201cWe can reprogram, build and upcycle what we need from what already exists in nature, rather than passively relying on nature to deliver it to us,\u201d Fishburne said.\n\nBreakout Labs has invested in 30 companies so far in the fields of biotech, data and materials science, and energy. Seven of those companies have gone on to raise Series A and two have closed Series B rounds.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe four new startups that Breakout Labs has invested in are:\n\nAzitra \u2013 The Farmington, Conn.-based startup is developing a \u201crecombinant strain of skin-safe bacterium that secrete therapeutic proteins.\u201d These proteins are missing from the skin\u2019s microbiome when a person suffers from problems like eczema or a staph infection.\n\nOpus 12 \u2013 Based in Berkeley, Calif. captures carbon emissions where this pollution is generated, and turns the CO2 into chemicals like methane, ethylene and ethanol, gases that are used to make plastics, surfactants, detergents and fuels that burn relatively clean, as compared to diesel and gasoline.\n\nSeatrec \u2013 A spinout from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, this Pasadena, Calif.-based company is creating tech that could replace Lithium batteries in some cases. Specifically, Seatrec makes a battery packed with phase change materials. These expand and contract when temperatures around the battery change by about 10-degrees, creating high pressure which is then stored and used to drive an electric generator. Seatrec systems can power unmanned, underwater vehicles called floats and gliders, used for oceanographic research.\n\nZymochem \u2013 Another Berkeley, Calif.-startup, Zymochem is developing microbes and processes to turn sugar, and other renewable feedstock, into valuable chemicals without emitting greenhouse gases. The company aims to sustainably produce the chemicals that are required to manufacture apparel, automotive plastics and food packaging, which are made using petroleum today.\n\nCorrections: This post was updated to correct typos, and to reflect the way that Breakout Labs\u2019 grants work versus convertible note deals which are typical for very early stage startups."}
