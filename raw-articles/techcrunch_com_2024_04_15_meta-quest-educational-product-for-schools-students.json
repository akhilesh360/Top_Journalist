On Monday, the company announced in a blog post that later this year it will be launching a new education product for Quest to position its VR headset as a go-to device for teaching in classrooms.\n\nThe product is yet to be named, but in the blog post describing it, Nick Clegg, the company\u2019s president of global affairs \u2014 the ex-politician who has become\u2019s Meta\u2019s executive most likely to be delivering messaging around more controversial and divisive topics \u2014 said that it will include a hub for education-specific apps and features, as well as the ability to manage multiple headsets at once without having to update each device individually.\n\nBusiness models for hardware and services also have yet to be spelled out. With nothing on the table, the company is framing it as a long-term bet.\n\n\u201cWe accept that it\u2019s going to take a long time, and we\u2019re not going to be making any money on this anytime soon,\u201d Clegg said in an interview with Axios.\n\nOn the plus side, a push into education could mean more diversified content for Quest users, along with a wider ecosystem of developers building for the platform \u2014 not the killer app critics say is still missing from VR, but at least more action.\n\nOn more problematic ground, the news is coming on the heels of a few other developments at the company that are less positive. Meta\u2019s instant messaging service WhatsApp has been getting a lot of heat over lowering the minimum age for users to 13 in the U.K. and EU (it had previously been 16).\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement arrives on the heels of Meta prompting Quest users to confirm their age so it can provide teens and preteens with appropriate experiences.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Meta said it will launch it first in the 20 markets where it already supports Quest for Business, Meta\u2019s workplace-focused $14.99/month subscription. That list includes the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and several other English-speaking markets, along with Japan and much of western Europe.\n\nThere are a number of companies already in the market exploring the idea of VR in the classroom, with names like Immersion VR, ClassVR and ArborXR, not to mention the likes of Microsoft, which has been pushing its HoloLens as an educational tool for a while now.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how ubiquitous VR use is in schools: one provider, ClassVR, claims that 40,000 classrooms worldwide are using its products.\n\nBut all the same, there remain hurdles to mass market usage. It\u2019s not clear, for example, whether strapping a headset to someone\u2019s face is necessarily a help in a live, educational environment, considering some of the research around young people already getting too much screen time as it is.\n\nAnd another big question mark will relate to the cost of buying headsets (Quest 3, the latest headset, starts at around $500 apiece for basic models), buying apps, and then subsequently supporting all of that infrastructure. Meta said that it has already donated Quest headsets to 15 universities in the U.S., but it\u2019s not clear how far it will go to subsidize growth longer term."}
