In a post on X, Rotman \u2014 who helped start QED in 2007 \u2014 declared that \u201cthe first business\u201d that he plans \u201con getting out of the ground is in the music industry.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to call me crazy for all the obvious reasons, but it\u2019s worth reserving judgment until you learn more about the business that\u2019s evolved in my head and sat on the shelf for years. It will be fun to build and could actually make a huge difference to an industry that none of us could imagine living without.\u201d\n\nRotman started Alexandria, Virginia-based QED, which today has $4 billion in assets under management, nearly two decades ago with Nigel Morris and Caribou Honig. He led the firm\u2019s investment in Credit Karma and played a role in QED\u2019s investments in unicorns such as GreenSky, Flywire, and SoFi. (In fact, QED was the first institutional money into Credit Karma.) Other companies that the firm has backed include Creditas, Nubank, AvidXchange, and Bitso.\n\nQED exclusively invests in companies building financial technology at the pre-seed to Series A stages.\n\nRotman, who goes by the handle \u201cThe Fintech Junkie\u201d on X, said he will transition to his new role on January 1, 2026. He will continue to serve in a part-time advisory role to QED over the coming years.\n\nBesides founding music startups, Rotman said he likely plans to write a book centered around his \u201cobservations and frameworks for the startup and VC worlds.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

I can\u2019t imagine a life without it even though ChatGPT and Claude are better writers than I am.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, QED Managing Partner Nigel Morris noted that he and Rotman had worked together for over 30 years \u2014 previously also at Capital One.\n\n\u201cFrank, at his core, is an entrepreneur and I have no doubt he will excel in his next chapter,\u201d he said.\n\nQED Investors\u2019 partner Amias Gerety will be promoted to lead QED\u2019s U.S. investment team."}
