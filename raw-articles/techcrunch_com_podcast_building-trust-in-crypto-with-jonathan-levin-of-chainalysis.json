Gensler has faced heavy criticism for his crackdown on crypto, including a recent lawsuit from 18 states, and is likely to be replaced under President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to oust Gensler.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump is meeting with Brian Armstrong, the CEO of crypto exchange Coinbase, to discuss potential personnel appointments. That same day, Trump said he wants Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to serve as his Commerce Secretary. Lutnick is a vocal crypto enthusiast who\u2019s been stablecoin giant Tether\u2019s Wall Street banker for years.\n\nThis is all to say, crypto is having a moment.\n\nThat\u2019s why on today\u2019s episode of Equity, we\u2019re bringing you a conversation between Rebecca Bellan and Jonathan Levin, the co-founder and CSO of blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.
