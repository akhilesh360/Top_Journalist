Crypto analyst Javon Marks noted a breakout that could rival the explosive 2017 bull run.\n\nIn a recent post on X, Marks highlighted a chart comparing the TOTAL3 index (total market cap of altcoins excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum) against the US money supply, suggesting that altcoins may be on the verge of a significant rally.\n\nA rise in TOTAL3 against the US money supply suggests that altcoins are gaining value relative to the total liquidity in the US economy, reflecting increased investor interest and capital inflow into altcoins.\n\nTOTAL3/US Money supply.

Comparing 2021 and 2025, the chart mirrors the 2021 altcoin season when top altcoins surged 174% against Bitcoin\u2019s 20% during the final leg. The pattern, a bullish reversal indicator, suggests a rally, with the analyst forecasting \"much higher levels\" for altcoins.\n\nMoustache\u2019s TOTAL3 analysis.

Technical analyst Crypto Scient explained that the recent rise in altcoin market cap is yet to reflect a higher time frame (HTF) bullish trend shift. The analyst noted that the TOTAL2 trend remained bearish after hitting resistance at the $1.25 trillion level, and said,\n\n\u201cSince both BTC and TOTAL are near the resistance zone and TOTAL2 still has some room, I am inclined to believe that we are distributing.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Crypto commentator DonaXBT argued that a significant breakdown in Bitcoin's dominance trendline is essential for altcoins to experience a substantial move. The accompanying chart reveals that Bitcoin dominance is above 60%, with the weekly uptrend still intact.\n\nBitcoin dominance.

Despite these lower volumes, market observers see this as a precursor to significant growth, suggesting that altcoins have yet to reach their peak momentum.\n\nBitcoin and Altcoins spot trading volume.

Historically, an index below 25 indicates Bitcoin dominance, but this can be a positive setup for altcoins. When the index climbs above 30-40, altcoins often experience significant pumps, driven by capital rotation from Bitcoin.\n\nWith trading volumes showing early signs of recovery and the Altcoin Season Index pointing to a shift, investors\u2019 optimism for an altcoin rally is growing.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows fall, but BTC whale activity points to bull market acceleration\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
