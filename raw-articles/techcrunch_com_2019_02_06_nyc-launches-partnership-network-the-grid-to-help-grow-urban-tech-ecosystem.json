The goal of the network is to link organizations, academia and local tech leaders in order to promote collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and resources.\n\nIn addition to connecting member companies and talent, The Grid will host various events, educational programs and co-innovation projects, while hopefully improving access to investors as well as pilot program opportunities. The Grid is launching with more than 70 member organizations \u2014 approved through an application and screening process \u2014 across various stages and sectors.\n\nIn recent years, the tech and startup scene in New York has notably ballooned \u2014 evolving from the Valley\u2019s obscure younger sibling to one of the top cities for talent, entrepreneurship and venture capital investment. And while the city has seen countless startups, VCs, accelerators and other entrepreneurial resources set up shop within its borders, getting the right tools in place is only part of the battle.\n\nNew York wants to prove its initiatives are more than just \u201cshow-and-tell\u201d projects and city officials believe that building a truly sustainable innovation economy is dependent on all its local resources working in conjunction, allowing entrepreneurship to permeate every arm of commerce. With an institutionalized network like The Grid, New York hopes it can further fuse its pockets of innovation into one well-oiled machine, consistently producing transformative ideas.\n\n\u201cThe Grid represents a promising new way for NYCEDC to work across sectors to strengthen collaboration and innovation, first in New York City and hopefully soon in many more cities across the country and around the world,\u201d said NYCEDC president and CEO James Patchett in a statement. \u201cIt signals that New York City is leading with a new approach to technology and startup culture, with a real focus on diversity, inclusion, equity, and community.\u201d\n\nAs one of the largest and most industrially diverse cities in the world, New York has naturally placed a heightened focus on the growing sector of \u201curban tech\u201d \u2014 which has been broadly categorized as innovation focused on improving city functionality, equality or ease of living. According to NYCEDC, the urban tech space has seen nearly $80 billion in VC investment since 2016, with nearly 10 percent going to New York-based beneficiaries.\n\nThe launch of The Grid is part of an expansion of NYCEDC\u2019s larger UrbanTech NYC program, which has already helped establish the New York innovation hubs New Lab, Urban Future Lab and Company. Alongside the membership network and a new site for UrbanTech NYC, NYCEDC is also launching The Grid Academy, an adjacent academic group with the mission of creating applied R&D partnerships between local academic institutions and corporate sponsors. The expansion of UrbanTech NYC represents the latest of several initiatives NYCEDC is pursuing to develop the broader ecosystem, coming just months after the EDC announced the launch of Cyber NYC, a $30 million investment initiative focused on growing New York\u2019s cybersecurity presence and infrastructure.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

New York\u2019s thriving urban technology community is a natural byproduct of what happens when you allow diversity, entrepreneurship and ambition to collide in one of the greatest cities in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Grid\u2019s first meeting will be held on February 19th at Samsung NEXT\u2019s New York HQ.
