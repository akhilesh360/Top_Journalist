However, the company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the filing refers to crypto disclosure guidelines set by the accounting standards update by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued in late 2023.\n\nAn excerpt from the DDC\u2019s F-20 annual report.
