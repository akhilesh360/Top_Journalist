According to Bloomberg, the tokens representing Galaxy Digital\u2019s shares could be used in decentralized finance applications, like borrowing or lending.\n\nGalaxy is among several crypto companies looking to access the US markets under a friendlier regulatory regime in the country.

Data from RWA.xyz shows the sector's market cap at $22.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of both global real-world asset values and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). However, it\u2019s growing fast, with a 111.8% increase over the past year.\n\nOne rising trend is tokenizing securities, essentially turning assets like stocks and treasury bonds into tradable tokens on the blockchain. Robinhood is considering building a blockchain that would allow retail investors in Europe to trade tokenized US securities like stocks. Galaxy Digital has plans to tokenize everything from stocks and fixed income to ETFs.\n\nAt the SEC\u2019s crypto roundtable on May 12, Chair Paul Atkins compared the tokenization of assets to the music industry moving from analog to digital, which, according to Atkins, greatly benefited the American economy.\n\nThe closer relationships that US President Donald Trump has developed with the industry have sparked new enthusiasm for crypto activity in the country.
