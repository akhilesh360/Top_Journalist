Along with a new CEO came a major pivot. With the Magic Leap 2, the startup went all in on enterprise \u2014 a far safer and more lucrative bet than the fickle world of gaming.\n\nStill, the Magic Leap 1 has continued to operate \u2014 good news for those who shelled $2,300 for the device when it finally arrived in the summer of 2018. At the end of next year, however, the augmented reality headset will effectively become a very expensive hunk of plastic and glass.\n\nThe well-funded firm alerted users via email that the system is being end-of-lifed when 2025 rolls around.\n\n\u201c[W]e are announcing that Magic Leap 1\u2019s end-of-life date will be December 31, 2024. Magic Leap 1 is no longer available for purchase but will continue to be supported through December 31, 2024,\u201d the company writes.\n\nShorter term, the product\u2019s various communications are being shuttered. The Magic Leap 1 Developer Forum and Discord channels are both being shuttered at the end of the month, while the company recommends people shift their business to the Magic Leap 2 board instead. Troubleshooting support and warranty claims will continue to be honored through 2024.\n\nMore details are offered in an FAQ.\n\nWhen that date rolls around, however, cloud services, apps and general functionality will all effectively brick. Perhaps we\u2019ll see a homebrew community emerge, though the true number of devices out in the wild is hazy, at best. One report suggested that the headset had sold around 6,000 devices in its first year.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

You can\u2019t, however, blame the technology. If AR\u2019s time ever truly comes, we can safely say that the Magic Leap 1 was ahead of it. And the device\u2019s sequel continues to build on that success.\n\nFrom my conversation with the company, it\u2019s safe to say Magic Leap has no short-term ambitions to return to the consumer market. Maybe someday scale will bring the price down to a manageable level and enough developers will be entrenched in the ecosystem to offer something meaningful.\n\nIn the meantime, the ball is very much in Apple\u2019s court with the Vision Pro. While the software giant\u2019s spatial computing approach is fairly different than what Magic Leap had initially targeted, it\u2019s fair to say the two share common DNA. This is also a relatively rare instance where Apple entering the category doesn\u2019t suck the air out of the room for smaller competitors. If anything, the Vision Pro is a validation for AR\u2019s true believers.\n\nI will be discussing Magic Leap\u2019s journey with CEO Peggy Johnson as part of the Disrupt Hardware Stage, later this month."}
