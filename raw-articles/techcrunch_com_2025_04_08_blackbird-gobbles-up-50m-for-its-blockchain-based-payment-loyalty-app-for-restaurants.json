Now, with some 1,000 restaurants signed up, CEO Ben Leventhal said Blackbird plans to use the money to launch its newest product, a cross-restaurant \u201cpoints\u201d service it\u2019s calling Blackbird Club, as well as to expand into more markets outside of New York (its headquarters), San Francisco, and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nWhy Charleston, you ask? \u201cCharleston punches above its class,\u201d Leventhal said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a great restaurant city for its size.\u201d It also appears to be Blackbird\u2019s equivalent of New Zealand for Meta, with Leventhal calling it \u201ca good test market for us.\u201d\n\nSpark Capital, a new backer, is leading this latest round, with participation also from Coinbase Ventures, Amex Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 three investors that backed Blackbird in its $24 million Series A in 2023. Valuation is not being disclosed, but for a point of reference, PitchBook notes that the startup was valued at around $124 million in that last round. The startup has raised $85 million to date.\n\nCoinbase and Amex are strategic names in that list.\n\nAmex acquired Resy, a reservations platform that Leventhal previously founded, in 2019. The two companies \u2014 Resy and Blackbird \u2014 are not integrating now, but \u201cit\u2019s fair to say we will,\u201d Leventhal said. Prior to Resy, the third restaurant-focused startup Leventhal founded, the food blog Eater, was also acquired: it\u2019s now part of Vox. No plans on how or if that\u2019ll lead to a partnership deal.\n\nBlackbird describes its Flynet payment service as a layer-three transaction protocol built on Coinbase\u2019s Base. Diners can use it to pay for meals at the table via Blackbird\u2019s app, as well as to redeem loyalty points when they visit restaurants.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

There are plenty of other loyalty and payment programs in the market, including a number that are direct competitors to Blackbird, like Punchh, Toast, and Lightspeed, built on more conventional financial structures.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it necessarily \u2018has to be built on blockchain,\u2019\u201d Leventhal said. \u201cVisa\u2019s network, more or less, was created using the same principles that we\u2019re using for Flynet, and obviously they didn\u2019t have blockchain.\u201d\n\nBut Leventhal pointed out, too, that \u201cthere are a few things that we do believe that over time will be important opportunities, and those opportunities will be based on being on-chain.\u201d These include how Blackbird and restaurants hold customer profiles and activity, he said. \u201cConsumers will be able to continue to own that profile,\u201d Leventhal told TechCrunch. It also relates to how Blackbird envisions its engagement with restaurants, he said: Each restaurant customer ultimately will be a shareholder of Blackbird.\n\nYou might think that, with two startups dedicated to the consumer-facing side of the restaurant trade, Leventhal might have had his fill of the business. As it turns out, he\u2019s still hungry for more.\n\nOwning restaurants has long been a challenging enterprise, but the economy and changing consumer habits have especially knocked the world of restaurants around a lot in the last few years.\n\nLeventhal cites figures from the National Restaurant Association that note that the average profitability of restaurants these days is under 5%, compared to an average of around 20% in the early 2000s.\n\nWhile platforms like Instagram and TikTok have turned the world into armchair foodies, producing legions of people who virally flock to the latest and coolest cafe, they are doing this amid a time of rapidly declining margins and heightened price sensitivity. These are areas that are only going to get tougher if the U.S. really locks down on its latest tariff hikes.\n\n\u201cThere is a disconnect in the restaurant industry between the popularity and the intensity of consumer love for restaurants and ultimately the profitability of the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nThat disconnect, of course, in startup thinking means opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe restaurant industry is made up of millions of local, small business owners around the world,\u201d Arianna Simpson, a general partner at a16z, told TechCrunch over email. \u201cThose restaurants are at the mercy of tech platforms that can charge a large, and often growing, percentage of a restaurant\u2019s margin.\u201d\n\nSimpson believes this is specifically where blockchain can play a role: improving that margin structure. \u201cBen\u2019s vision is for a network that is owned by the restaurants and the diners themselves, which is something that only blockchains enable,\u201d she said, adding that Blackbird is already saving its restaurant customers 3-4% in payment processing fees."}
