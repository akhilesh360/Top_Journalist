Even as the most successful and powerful data miners of the modern web are undoubtedly the dominant consumer platforms \u2014 Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon in the West, and China\u2019s WeChat in Asia \u2014 whose vast digital empires yield them both quantity and quality of data to use as they please.\n\nYet these tech giants aren\u2019t generally in the business of sharing their data holdings to help others \u2014 unless you want to pay them to target digital advertising on your behalf.\n\nWhich is where Atomico-backed startup Teralytics spies its own big data opportunity. It\u2019s built a platform selling analytics services to customers such as government agencies and transport companies that want to understand complex problems relating to human mobility \u2014 so analyzing things like transport pressure points, or considering the optimum location for a new road, or even monitoring urban air quality without the need to deploy CO2 sensors.\n\nThe European startup has been building its analytics platform for around four years at this stage, working in semi stealth up to now to put its core tech in place, while also delivering projects with early partners and customers, such as the air quality monitoring example cited above.\n\nThe original idea for the business was spun out of ETH Zurich university, sparked by a conversation one of the co-founders had with a local telco which was looking for help analyzing commuter data on behalf of the government.\n\nCo-founder Georg Polzer says he and his co-founders ended up sleeping in the company\u2019s data center as they worked to write code to come up with the answer to the problem \u2014 though he notes he\u2019s past the point of personally pulling coding all-nighters himself now.\n\n\u201cBack at ETH we were doing a lot of data analysis and by living in Zurich, working in Zurich we got exposure to a Swiss telecom company,\u201d he tells TechCrunch. \u201cI got into a conversation with a person there, who mentioned the Swiss government wants to understand how long people travel across the country, to leave their home and reach their destination during the day, and that person at Swisscom said can you help us? And we said sure, we can do it. And with this project we started the company.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Along with Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m\u2019s Atomico fund, investors include Swiss VC firm Lakestar and Hong Kong-based Horizons Ventures.\n\nIts current go-to-market proposition is focused on analyzing human mobility and behavior to meet the changing needs of urban planners and transport providers \u2014 sitting under another techie umbrella: smart cities.\n\n\u201cBig cases that we\u2019ve either worked on or are working on include things like how can a large transit network operator minimize the amount of money they spend on operating it whilst at the same time providing a better service to citizens,\u201d says incoming CEO Alastair MacLeod, who brings a background in telcos to help with the startup\u2019s next steps ramping up commercialization of its platform. \u201cWe also work with long distance operators on what should their capital plans look like for the next ten years.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s all centered around\u2026 the large topics of what\u2019s happening to urban environments and what\u2019s happening to transportation as new modes of transport come on stream. It\u2019s just a huge and mushrooming area and we play directly into that space, helping inform the current providers on how they could do better. But also helping them think about what comes next.\u201d\n\nPolzer points to disruption already happening in the transport space as ride-hailing providers like Uber push into cities and station-free bike sharing startups like Ofo proliferate. While also noting larger changes looming \u2014 such as electric and autonomous cars \u2014 which promise to even more radically reshaping urban infrastructure in the coming years.\n\nCities will need powerful analytics tools to understand and response to these changes, he argues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole technology shift happening in how we move around, and how we organize cities, and this shift needs to be understood and modeled and designed right \u2014 and the right decisions need to be taken,\u201d says Polzer. \u201cAnd I think we really can play that key role to help shape this wave of change.\u201d\n\nEvery single mayor I talk to says can you please help me understand the effect of Uber and Lyft on my city.\n\n\u201cEvery single mayor I talk to says can you please help me understand the effect of Uber and Lyft on my city,\u201d he adds. \u201cThese are questions they have. It\u2019s very, very much on their minds.\u201d\n\nSo \u2014 to the really big question \u2014 where is Teralytics sourcing the data that powers its platform? How is it able to track city dwellers\u2019 movements in such detail and link them to highly specific behaviors?\n\nIn the first instance it\u2019s partnering with telcos whose mobile subscriber bases offer a large, rich, reliable and representative source of population data to be mined for insights, says Polzer, while also looking at bolting on additional data sources as it moves forward (integrating wi-fi network data is something it\u2019s currently working on, for example).\n\nBut the really big data crutch here is definitely telcos \u2014 who, after tech\u2019s platform giants, hold some of the richest and most detailed data around. Even as they also typically have more stringent regulatory strictures (vs Internet businesses) on what they can do with customers\u2019 sensitive personal data.\n\nAnd with very good reason \u2014 given they provide access to connectivity, not just individual apps and services, affording them a highly intimate overview of their users\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about operator data is that usually in the market there are three to four operators, which always have at least 10 to 15 per cent marketshare. And if you look at other data sources, there\u2019s just no other data sources with that breadth across the population,\u201d says Polzer, discussing the advantage of attaching a big data business to carriers\u2019 heavily loaded pipes.\n\n\u201cAlso telcos, are debiased among the population; it\u2019s very nicely distributed \u2014 this means you have rich people, poor people, young people, old people. Which makes the extrapolation much much more reliable vs if you just get data from one smartphone app which is used by teenagers in certain areas. So this data is very nicely balanced and therefore can be extrapolated out to the whole population.\u201d\n\nHe also talks up the resilience of relying on telcos for the core data-set \u2014 given that major network operators are not likely to vanish overnight. Whereas data plays that rely on an app source, for example, might be more vulnerable to passing fads taking them out of business and cutting off the flow of behavioral intel.\n\nPlus he argues that the national constraints of operators help bolster Teralytics against shifts in individual partners\u2019 business decisions \u2014 by positioning the business to have additional potential data providers standing by as the nature of the telecoms market necessitates it working with \u201cmany operators across different markets\u201d.\n\nThe startup has worked with eight different telcos in total up to now, says MacLeod, and has three \u201cactive discussions\u201d in new markets, while also flagging a recently signed partnership with Three Hong Kong. Current customers include governments, transportation operators and companies in Germany, Singapore and the U.S. (It\u2019s not disclosing all its carrier partners by name but \u2014 for the record \u2014 says it\u2019s not currently working with TechCrunch\u2019s parent Oath\u2019s parent Verizon.)\n\nIt uses machine learning algorithms to extrapolate insights from its carrier partners\u2019 data-sets \u2014 with key data boiling down to location information based on cell tower pings (and wi-fi data incoming), combined with clickstream data from mobile devices, which mean it can derive more granular insights by triangulating which app/website is being used at a given location/velocity \u2014 so for example, Teralytics\u2019 platform could identify not just that a group of people are traveling around a city in cars but that they\u2019re traveling in ride-share vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the data is you get a lot of data points per person per day,\u201d says Polzer. \u201cFor example, in comparison to app SDK data, you might see a person once or twice a day when that person opens the app. While we see that person, guaranteed, around 150 times a day. When you them look into the use-case we tackle \u2014 which is mobility, understanding how humans move around, which routes they take, which mode of transport they take \u2014 you need to have that path, that journey of a person. And we believe the only data that really provides that is telecom data.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of the reasons why operators work with us is because we exactly have developed an ability to, we call it, extrapolate \u2014 so from one sub-set of the population we extrapolate out to the whole population,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily know this individual person did that individual thing, but when you\u2019re talking about it in terms of groups \u2014 which we do anyway for privacy reasons \u2014 you can infer patterns of behavior around how many did this sort of thing, or how many took a ride-share, which we may or may not identify by an individual brand, vs how many took some other mode of transport. But it all effectively comes from different types of data being overlaid in a fairly sophisticated machine learning engine,\u201d says MacLeod.\n\nBalancing privacy concerns is clearly going to be a critical consideration for the success of the venture \u2014 which needs telcos to buy in to pump in the big data fuel, and therefore also needs their customers be comfortable with the idea that their personal data \u2014 i.e. information about where they go and what they do online \u2014 might be being shared with, for example, government agencies.\n\nSo even if you start from the premise of carrier data being anonymized, as Teralytics says is the case here, a system could be built that tracks an unnamed user\u2019s location and displays a trace from a street address to a commercial address and back again twice a day, for example, and the person looking at that data might easily infer they\u2019re seeing a person\u2019s home and workplace \u2014 and then it\u2019s potentially very easy to re-identify that individual.\n\nHowever, Teralytics claims no such re-identification risks are attached to its system because of how it\u2019s baked privacy considerations into the design. Polzer says it\u2019s using a variety of proprietary techniques to handle the data in a way that preserves user privacy \u2014 although he won\u2019t go into too much detail, claiming commercial sensitivity. But says the system has passed muster with strict German data protection watchdogs, and expresses confidence it\u2019s robust enough for any data protection regime.\n\nOne key aspect is that as well as anonymizing the data they also claim they are never linking data traces to individual identities \u2014 rather they only provide analyses based on aggregation of groups\u2019 movements and habits. They also perform analysis of the data on site, behind carriers\u2019 firewalls, to reduce potential security risks \u2014 so they\u2019re not lifting subscriber data elsewhere for processing.\n\n\u201cWe are already fully compliant with GDPR,\u201d says MacLeod, referencing the incoming European Union data protection regulation that\u2019s bringing in new privacy requirements for companies handling EU citizens\u2019 personal data, as well as ramping up penalties for privacy violations.\n\n\u201cAs an extra measure in Germany we are rehashing every 24 hours. But of course you still want to do long term profiles so we have developed a technique to actually still do that and be compliant and getting approval by the Germany privacy regulator for that,\u201d adds Polzer.\n\nClearly the hope is that their approach has been sensitive enough and robust enough to entirely defang any privacy concerns, regulatory or otherwise, though a lot may depend on the perception of the mobile subscribers\u2019 whose data is ultimately fueling these commercial insights. (Which may be why the initial go-to-market strategy is focused on a goal that can be perceived as socially beneficial \u2014 after all, which good citizens doesn\u2019t want to live in a \u2018smarter\u2019 city?)\n\nIn the case of Telefonica Germany, one partner Teralytics will name, Polzer says the carrier is providing an opt-out for users who do not want even anonymized details about how and where they travel and which apps and mobile websites they\u2019re looking at, to be used for third party analytics.\n\nThough clearly not every carrier it works with might decide to offer the same choice to its subscribers.\n\n\u201cOf course there are some slightly relaxed rules [in some telco jurisdictions],\u201d concedes Polzer. \u201cOn the other hand we need to invest in developing an algorithm that works outside Germany\u2026 We can\u2019t afford building a new algorithm for every single country. And also, to be frank, we very much view GDPR as the future \u2014 we expect every regulator to, in the end, move in that direction anyway. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re building a business that hopes for loopholes or depends on loopholes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe build the same privacy standard into the solutions we build, regardless of what the law does or doesn\u2019t require in that country,\u201d adds MacLeod.\n\nDoing advertising in an opt-out way \u2014 we don\u2019t think that\u2019s really sustainable in the long term.\n\nZooming out, to consider the telcos themselves, why do they need Teralytics? MacLeod demurs on this question, saying its partners don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it \u2014 given they do have their own in-house analytics teams \u2014 but rather the sales pitch is around strategic focus; with telcos being most concerned about optimizing their own business processes, whereas Teralytics can offer itself as the \u201cyoung, fast, flexible\u201d startup partner which can be out in the market selling services to third parties to make more of carriers\u2019 data holdings, as well as also supporting them to drive more of their own core revenue if they wish.\n\nThe basic business model is a revenue share with carrier partners on any third party analytics deals Teralytics (or the two combined) are able to cut \u2014 though MacLeod won\u2019t go into specifics, beyond billing the proposition as a \u201clow cost, low risk, easy way into big data analytics\u201d for telcos to eke more value out of their data holdings.\n\nPolzer also points to the market constraints of telcos as a helper here \u2014 noting this characteristic means they\u2019re not well-positioned to recoup the kind of investment needed to build a comparable machine learning analytics platform. Whereas Teralytics can invest because it can play and (it hopes) scale across multiple markets.\n\n\u201cA lot of the partners we\u2019ve got now and some of the ones we\u2019re talking to now they fundamentally believe that data is the new gold and it\u2019s going to be the new currency,\u201d says MacLeod. \u201cWe have value to add because we\u2019re really good at what we do and it\u2019s hard, especially when you consider not only the complexity of the machine learning that has to go into providing these insights, but\u2026 the privacy \u2014 this isn\u2019t something that you can just go hire a bunch of data scientists off the streets and do it.\u201d\n\nOf course one market that some telcos are demonstrably very keen on expanding into, based on how much they can infer about their customers, is digital advertising.\n\nJust this week U.S. carrier Verizon, for example, announced a rewards program for its subscribers that requires them to agree to share personal data (such as their browsing habits) with its digital ad division, so expressly for marketing purposes, in exchange for the ability to earn loyalty rewards. Ergo, it\u2019s gunning to build up an ad targeting empire \u2014 a la Google and Facebook. (And for that reason recently spent big to gobble up veteran digital ad player, Yahoo.)\n\nSo is helping carriers enhance their ability to target ads at their users something that Teralytics wants to do too?\n\n\u201cAt the moment it\u2019s not the focus,\u201d says Polzer, after a slight hesitation. \u201cOf course we are getting approached by operators about this topic, but at the moment it\u2019s definitely not the focus.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in most of the territories we operate in it\u2019s not allowed anyway, so it\u2019s relatively straightforward,\u201d adds MacLeod.\n\nMight the startup look at moving into that line of business in future \u2014 if/where regulatory conditions are favorable? \u201cOur focus for the business is clear and it\u2019s not that,\u201d returns MacLeod. \u201cThe guys started out, long before I turned up, wanting to uncover insights into human behavior. And even though I\u2019m here now, and I\u2019m the commercialization guy, and we\u2019re looking at other sources of data besides telco data, the intention is to build on that. We see lots of interesting big scale trends in terms of how people move around differently, how people live differently\u2026 There\u2019s so much huge interesting stuff emerging from that that\u2019s why we\u2019ve placed the focus on smart cities and transportation, and the intersection of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never say never to anything but I can tell you with absolute certainty it\u2019s not our focus,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe are privacy by design throughout so whatever we do we\u2019ll never go anywhere near anything that breaches people\u2019s privacy because it\u2019s literally built into the fabric of the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing advertising in an opt-out way \u2014 we don\u2019t think that\u2019s really sustainable in the long term,\u201d continues Polzer, when I press on how interested telcos are in growing digital advertising businesses, going on to suggest that the point at which Teralytics might apply its platform to a digital advertising use-case would be \u201cif telco operators are able to build a meaningful opt-in base\u201d (i.e. for individually targeted marketing).\n\n\u201cWhich we haven\u2019t seen in any market yet,\u201d he adds. \u201cI do hope and wish all the telcos luck and success in making this transformation. But I think they would have to build up a meaningful opt-in base for us to play a role there. But once they\u2019re ready, I think we are probably the best providers of human mobility data.\u201d\n\nOne of Teralytics\u2019 ongoing partner conversations is \u201cspecifically about an opt-in case\u201d, adds MacLeod. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking at this, it\u2019s very early stage for us. We haven\u2019t decided to work with the partner at all \u2014 let alone whether we want to participate with that case. But for me the concerns go away around why not to do it if everybody who\u2019s potentially is going to be targeted by a solution has positively said yes I would like to be. Rather than they haven\u2019t got around to saying that they wouldn\u2019t like to be.\u201d\n\nWhatever the outcome of that particular carrier conversation, right now, the business goal for the team at this stage of business development \u2014 several years in, with multi millions raised and what it\u2019s pitching as a solid platform under its feet to get carriers to jump on board \u2014 is accelerating commercialization. The plan is to dial up sales and customer acquisition by building out the commercial team and putting its energy into front office ops for the coming year. Aka \u201cit\u2019s time to really ramp this thing,\u201d as MacLeod puts it.\n\n\u201cIn the next 12 months our plans are to accelerate in the markets that we have \u2014 so we\u2019re active now in four markets already, as in we\u2019ve got four significant live partners in the US, in Germany, in Singapore and in Hong Kong,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are actively talking to partners that would give us either two or three territories so we will increase the geographical footprint because the platform itself is so replicable and so scalable and the way that they\u2019ve built it, even though the nature of our relationship is slightly different it\u2019s\u2026 not very far away from plug and play. From the day that we decide to do it it\u2019s two or three weeks until we can be live with some insights in any market.\u201d\n\n\u201cA big chunk of our platform is highly productized,\u201d adds Polzer. \u201cWe are very flexible in the way of extracting number of subway trips vs number of car trips. One customer might come with a question: \u2018how often do people take the train?\u2019 \u2014 another customer say: \u2018what happens if I reconstruct a bridge?\u2019 and for us these might be different customer questions but the underlying analysis is the same.\u201d\n\nThe underlying question for Teralytics\u2019 big data play is what will mobile users say? Will they feel comfortable if their carrier decides to track and analyze their personal data for commercial gain? Providing a stable and reliably affirmative answer there may prove to be this startup\u2019s biggest challenge."}
