But one that has flown under the radar, increasingly thought to be key to certain diseases but woefully understudied, is RNA. With $35 million in new funding, Atomic AI aims to do for RNA what AlphaFold did for proteins, and find entirely new treatments in the process.\n\nIf you can still recall your high school biology, you probably remember RNA as sort of a middle man between DNA (long term information storage) and proteins (the machinery of cellular life at the molecular level). But like most things in nature, it doesn\u2019t seem to be quite that simple, explained Atomic AI\u2019s CEO and founder, Raphael Townshend.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this central dogma that DNA goes to RNA, which goes to proteins. But it\u2019s emerged in recent years that it does much more than just encode information,\u201d he said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cIf you look at the human genome, about 2% becomes protein at some point. But 80 percent becomes RNA. And it\u2019s doing\u2026 who knows what? It\u2019s vastly underexplored.\u201d\n\nCompared to DNA and proteins, little work has been done in this area. Academia has focused on other pieces of the puzzle and pharmaceuticals have, partly as a consequence of that, pursued proteins as the mechanisms for drugs. The result is a severe lack of knowledge and data on RNA structures.\n\nBut what Atomic AI posits is that RNA is functional and worth pursuing as a method of treatment. The secret is in the \u201cnon-coding\u201d regions of RNA, which are like the header and footer on a document. They do protein-like work but aren\u2019t proteins \u2014 and they\u2019re not the only example.\n\nYou can think about RNA strands as beaded necklaces, much more string than bead. The string is \u201cfloppy\u201d and more or less what its detractors think it is: an intermediary. But every once in a while you get a really interesting knot that seems unlikely to have formed by accident. As with proteins, if you can figure out their structure, that goes a long way towards understanding what they do and how they can be affected.\n\n\u201cThe key is to find those beads, those structured bits. It\u2019s high information content, it\u2019s targetable, and it\u2019s likely functional as well,\u201d said Townshend. \u201cIt\u2019s seen in drug discovery as a key new frontier.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Then, if you do build those methods, you can be first in line to use them. Atomic AI is doing both simultaneously.\n\nThe core of Atomic\u2019s IP is, though this is something of a simplification, an AlphaFold for RNA. The biology is different, and the way the models work is different, but the idea is the same: a machine learning model trained on a limited set of a type of molecule that can make accurate predictions about the structure of other molecules of that type.\n\nWhat\u2019s wild is that Townshend\u2019s team made just such a model, which outperforms others by a large margin, by feeding it the characteristics of just 18 RNA molecule structures \u201cpublished between 1994 and 2006.\u201d This absolutely bare-bones model wiped the floor with others, as disclosed in a front-page article published in Science in 2021.\n\nSince then, Townshend was quick to add, the company has vastly augmented its models and methods with more raw material, much of which it has created itself in its own wet labs. They call the updated set of tools PARSE: Platform for AI-driven RNA Structure Exploration.\n\n\u201cThe Science paper represented an initial breakthrough, but we have actually generated a huge amount of\u2026 structure-adjacent data,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot the full structure itself, but data related to the structure, tens of millions data points; the same scale of data you\u2019d need to train big language models. And combined with other machine learning work, we have been able to dramatically improve both the speed and accuracy from the paper.\u201d\n\nThat means Atomic AI is the only one who, publicly at least, has a system that can take a RNA molecule\u2019s raw data in and spit out a reasonably confident estimate of its structure. That\u2019s useful to anyone doing RNA research in or out of medicine, and with gene therapies and mRNA vaccines, the field is definitely on the rise.\n\nWith such a tool you could go one of two ways: license it as a \u201cstructure as a service\u201d platform, as Townshend put it, or use it yourself. Atomic has opted for the latter, and is pursuing its own drug discovery program.\n\nThis approach has a notable difference from a lot of the AI discovery processes out there. The general idea is you have a protein, say one you want to inhibit expression of in the human body, but what you don\u2019t have is a chemical that binds reliably and exclusively to that protein, exactly where and when you want it to (and cheaply, if possible).\n\nAI drug discovery efforts tend to produce thousands, millions, even billions of candidate molecules that might work, rank them, and let the wet labs start working through the list as fast as they can. If you can find one that meets those above characteristics, you can produce a novel drug or replace a more expensive one on the market. But the key thing is you\u2019re competing to find new binders to a known protein.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just finding binders, we\u2019re finding what\u2019s targetable in the first place. The reason that\u2019s interesting is because at the end of the day, these big pharmaceuticals care more about novel biology than novel molecules. You\u2019re enabling something that wasn\u2019t doable before by finding this new target, as opposed to augmenting the number of molecules available to target it,\u201d said Townshend.\n\nNot only that, but some proteins have been found to be nigh undruggable for whatever reason, producing illnesses resistant to medication. RNA could allow treatment of these same illnesses by making an end run around the problem protein.\n\nFor the present, Atomic AI has narrowed down the list to certain cancers that result in pathological overproduction of proteins (and hence good options for preempting the mechanism), and neurodegenerative diseases that may also benefit from upstream intervention.\n\nOf course all this work is immensely costly, necessitating as it does a large amount of both lab work and intense data science. Fortunately the company has raised a $35 million A round, led by Playground Global, with participation from 8VC, Factory HQ, Greylock, NotBoring, AME Cloud Ventures, as well as angels Nat Friedman, Doug Mohr, Neal Khosla, and Patrick Hsu. (The company previously raised a $7 million seed round.)\n\n\u201cPeople have picked all the low-hanging fruit in protein land,\u201d said Townshend. \u201cNow there\u2019s new biology to go after.\u201d"}
