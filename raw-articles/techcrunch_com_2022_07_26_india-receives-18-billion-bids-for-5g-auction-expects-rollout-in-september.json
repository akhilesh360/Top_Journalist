The auction and details of the top bidders are expected to become clearer tomorrow, when the auction is expected to reach its completion.\n\nAmbani\u2019s Reliance Jio Infocomm, which counts Google and Meta among its backers, has long expressed enthusiasm about the 5G upgrade.

As subscribers migrate to 5G, 4G subscriptions are forecast to decline annually to an estimated 700 million subscriptions in 2027.\u201d"}
