The company recently signed a deal with energy provider AES for three solar projects across the Midwest, one each in Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri.\n\nThe ramp up reflects the immediacy of Microsoft\u2019s needs. When it comes to powering data centers, it\u2019s hard to argue with solar. Quick to install, inexpensive, and modular, it\u2019s a perfect fit for tech companies that need electricity now.\n\nMicrosoft has been tapping solar with some regularity. In February, it contracted 389 megawatts from three solar projects across Illinois and Texas. And late last year, the company announced it was anchoring a $9 billion renewable power coalition that\u2019s organized by Acadia. The Redmond-based company\u2019s own renewable portfolio already includes over 34 GW of capacity.\n\nWhile tech companies have shown increasing interest in nuclear power in recent months, the cost and speed advantages of renewables have kept solar deals flowing.\n\nThough renewable power on its own doesn\u2019t have the same consistency as nuclear or natural gas, developers are increasingly pairing it with battery storage to provide around-the-clock electricity.\n\nThe combination is more expensive than solar or wind on its own, but given the rapid declines in cost for both solar and batteries, so-called hybrid power plants are beginning to encroach on prices for a new natural gas generating capacity.\n\nSo far, new nuclear prices have remained significantly higher than either renewables or natural gas power plants.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Demand for new computing power has risen at such a rate that up to half of all new AI servers could be underpowered by 2027. Most new natural gas and nuclear power plants aren\u2019t scheduled to come online until several years after that.\n\nBut renewables can start supplying power quickly, with utility-scale solar projects starting to produce electrons in about 18 months.\n\nThat speed has proven attractive, leading to some massive deals: Microsoft, for example, signed a deal with Brookfield Asset Management last summer for 10.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity in the U.S. and Europe, all of which will be delivered by 2030."}
