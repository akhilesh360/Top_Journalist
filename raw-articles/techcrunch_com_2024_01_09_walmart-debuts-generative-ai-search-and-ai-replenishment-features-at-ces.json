For example, you could ask Walmart to return search results for things needed for a \u201cfootball watch party,\u201d instead of specifically typing in searches for chips, wings, drinks or a 90-inch TV. These enhanced search results will span categories, rivaling Google\u2019s SGE (Search Generative Experience), which can recommend products and show various factors to consider, along with reviews, prices, images and more.\n\nAhead of CES, the company had demonstrated an AI shopping assistant that would let customers interact with a chatbot as they shopped, to ask questions and receive personalized product suggestions, as well. At the time, Walmart teased that a generative AI-powered search feature was also in the works. It suggested customers could ask for things like a \u201cunicorn-themed birthday party\u201d and get results like unicorn-themed napkins, balloons, streamers and more. Now the feature is rolling out on mobile devices, iOS first.\n\nAnother potentially promising use of AI involves the replenishment of frequently ordered items.\n\nWalmart will initially test this use case with Walmart InHome Replenishment, which will use AI and its existing replenishment expertise combined to create automated online shopping carts for customers with items they regularly order. Because it\u2019s only available through the InHome program, these items are then delivered to a customer\u2019s fridge in their kitchen or garage using the smart lock-powered InHome delivery service, but it will not be a subscription service.\n\nThe company also noted that customers will be able to remove items from their basket, as needed, and the service will adjust to customer\u2019s changing needs over time.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

However, the online retailer has been putting AI to work in other ways, including by helping connect customers with the right product by summarizing product reviews, highlighting key attributes or helping them find clothes that fit.\n\nAnother new Walmart product making a debut at CES is \u201cShop with Friends,\u201d an AR shopping tool that lets customers share virtual outfits they create with their friends and then get feedback on their finds. The tool combines Walmart\u2019s AI-powered virtual try-on tech, launched last year, with social features.\n\nCEO Doug McMillon referred to the suite of new products as something he called \u201cadaptive retail\u201d \u2014 that is, retail experiences that are personalized and flexible.\n\n\u201cWhile omnichannel retail has been around for decades, this new type of retail \u2014 adaptive retail \u2014 takes it a step further, said Suresh Kumar, global chief technology officer, and chief development officer, Walmart Inc., in a statement shared ahead of the CES keynote. \u201cIt\u2019s retail that is not only e-commerce or in-store, but a single, unified retail experience that seamlessly blends the best aspects of all channels. And for Walmart, adaptive retail is rooted in a clear focus on people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company touched on other ways it\u2019s employing AI, as well.\n\nWalmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club will introduce an AI and computer vision-powered technology that helps solve the problem of waiting in line for receipt verification when exiting the store. The pilot, currently running in 10 locations, will confirm members have paid for their items without requiring a store associate to check their charts. Instead, computer vision tech will capture images of customers\u2019 carts and AI will speed the process of matching cart items to sales. Walmart expects to bring the tech to its nearly 600 clubs by year-end.\n\nIn another area, Walmart\u2019s generative AI tool for store associates, My Assistant, will be expanded to 11 countries outside the U.S. in 2024, where it will work in employees\u2019 native languages. Already, the tool has become available in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua and is on track for launches in India and South Africa. My Assistant helps employees with writing, summarizing large documents and offering \u201cthought starters\u201d to spark creativity, Walmart says.\n\nOn the matter of AI, McMillon stressed that the company wouldn\u2019t prioritize the technology without considering the potential implications. Instead, Walmart\u2019s \u201cunderlying principle is that we should use technology to serve people and not the other way around,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, McMillon admitted that AI will mean some jobs will be eliminated.\n\n\u201cNo doubt some tasks will go away and some roles will change. And some of them should, like the ones that involve lifting heavy weights or doing repetitive tasks,\u201d the exec explained. \u201cAs that\u2019s happening, we\u2019re designing new roles that our associates tell us are more enjoyable and satisfying, and also often result in higher pay. So we\u2019re investing to help our associates transition to this shared future,\u201d McMillon added.\n\nDuring the keynote, McMillon also brought Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella onstage, after announcing that Walmart used large language models from Azure OpenAI alongside its own retail-specific models.\n\nNadella spoke broadly about the breakthroughs made possible with generative AI, including in areas like coding, productivity apps, like Microsoft\u2019s own, healthcare, education and more, adding that with new technology, \u201cone has to be mindful that you want to be able to amplify the opportunity with it\u2026and then also be very mindful of the unintended consequences of this technology.\u201d\n\nOutside of AI, Walmart is looking to other new technology for faster deliveries.\n\nThe company announced it\u2019s expanding its drone delivery service in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metro to 1.8 million households, or 75% of the metroplex area. The deliveries, which take place in 30 minutes or less, are powered by Wing and Zipline. Walmart also notes that 75% of the 120,000 items in a Walmart Supercenter meet the size and weight requirements for drone delivery. To date, Walmart has done over 20,000 drone deliveries in its two-year trial."}
