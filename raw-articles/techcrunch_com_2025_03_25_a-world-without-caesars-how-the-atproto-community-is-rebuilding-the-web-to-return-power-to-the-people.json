At the event, developers, engineers, founders, and even members of the Bluesky team, including CEO Jay Graber, were in attendance. Many in the community were meeting each other for the first time after having only ever communicated online.\n\nBut although Bluesky is the largest app built on ATProto at this time, the social network itself was not the ATmosphere Conference\u2019s focus. Here, Bluesky was just another developer \u2014 albeit a prominent one, given its stewardship of ATProto, the social networking protocol that offers a framework for building a decentralized social network.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nInstead, the conference was dedicated to the protocol itself and its many possibilities, which include building not only other types of social apps, but also communities and giving people a way to sign in across apps and web services with an open social identity via the authentication standard OAuth, and more.\n\nThe conference was about putting users back in control over their data, as well as their algorithms and their overall online experience.\n\nIn short, the 150+ people in attendance, alongside others in the community who attended virtually, are working to rebuild the web by putting the power back in the hands of the people who actually use the web.\n\nThat also means, to some extent, taking the power away from the billionaire tech oligarchs \u2014 the \u201cCaesars,\u201d as Graber\u2019s viral T-shirt mocking Mark Zuckerberg recently alluded to; these tech CEOs now control the majority of our online experience, from search to social connection, to communication to productivity, and beyond.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that self-described anarchists, mutual aid devotees, and open source advocates could be found among the ATProto conference\u2019s attendees.\n\nBut for some in attendance, longtime idealism has been tempered by the reality of what they\u2019ve already built and watched fail, including public products like Twitter and earlier efforts at decentralized apps.\n\nThis time around, they aim to learn from those mistakes.\n\nKicking off the event, Blaine Cook, the co-author of the OAuth standard and protocol WebFinger, and former lead developer at Twitter, spoke of his time at the social network that\u2019s now called X. While there, he coined the word \u201ctweet\u201d and designed replies before watching Twitter become \u201ccorrupted by capital and a lack of imagination,\u201d he said. Yet he still thinks of Twitter as the \u201cmost visceral representation of public human communication and ideas that anyone has ever created.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nCook, who was pushed out of Twitter for trying to decentralize it, compared today\u2019s decentralized social web, which includes Bluesky, as more akin to a jungle \u2014 something that makes sense for the individual creatures within it but is seemingly chaotic to outside observers.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true in these early days where multiple protocols are in use, including not only ATProto, but also ActivityPub (which underpins apps like Mastodon and Threads), Nostr, Farcaster, and others. Even the web\u2019s inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, is working on decentralized technologies designed to give the power back to the users.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known in my bones for almost decades now that a more free social system was both possible and inevitable,\u201d Cook told the audience, \u201cand it\u2019s always a revolution that\u2019s really stuck with me.\u201d\n\nCook\u2019s speech set the tone for the event: one that acknowledges the missteps of the past but also holds hope for the future.\n\nLater, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber spoke of the promise that the web once held, and how she later grew pessimistic as it turned into a tool to surveil and control instead of liberate and create.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\n\u201cWe have built a civilization of the mind in cyberspace, but we\u2019ve ended up giving over our lives to large, centralized platforms whose CEOs have styled themselves as self-made monarchs of the kingdoms that we\u2019ve built for them with our data and our time,\u201d said Graber.\n\n\u201cWe have to remember where the power really lies because we gave them that power and we can take it back.\u201d\n\nAt her speech\u2019s conclusion, the audience erupted with applause and hoots that lasted a good half a minute. This was no mere developers\u2019 conference. This was a movement.\n\nOther presenters showed off their projects, detailed various aspects of the ATProto technology, and spoke about what\u2019s ahead. Some proposed solutions to current issues.\n\nSpeakers at the event contributed their specific expertise, whether that was addressing the challenges around online communication, finding pathways to funding, or even experimenting with wild ideas, like running Bluesky on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer.\n\nBlackSky founder Rudy Fraser hit an emotional note on Saturday when talking about using ATProto to build communities. His project today offers moderation and support that makes social media a safer place for Black users, including those migrating from the online community known as Black Twitter. Eventually, BlackSky may run on all of its own ATProto-based infrastructure and offer its own consumer-facing client.\n\nHowever, conference attendees were reminded that new technologies alone aren\u2019t the answer \u2014 there\u2019s a need for a whole ecosystem of support and funding for these efforts, too.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nFor instance, technologist and feed builder \u00c6ndra Rininsland spoke up on Sunday about the struggles the trans community has faced \u2014 and continues to face \u2014 even on open social platforms.\n\nOne part of the challenge is that the people who run moderation services like Bluesky labelers (who flag or auto-hide posts you don\u2019t want to see) are often personally and financially burdened by their efforts. They can burn out and break down, as Rininsland said she had \u2014 twice.\n\nBut despite this, she still expressed optimism, pointing to projects like Northsky Social, which is building on the ideas put forth by BlackSky to use ATProto to create a safer social media experience for the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ambitious goals, but we\u2019re trying,\u201d Rininsland said. \u201cTrans people won\u2019t be silenced by this or any other administration. And if it means we have set up an entire parallel infrastructure, our entire damn social network, then you bet your asses we\u2019ll do that.\u201d\n\nUnlike the \u201cCareless People\u201d who built Facebook, the ATProto community aims to mitigate the harm that introducing new technologies can bring, and they\u2019re looking to experts who can help guide them as they build.\n\nOn Sunday, Erin Kissane, a content and editorial strategist who once wrote a 40,000-word essay on how Facebook contributed to the genocide in Myanmar, joined remotely (while under the weather, no less!) to share with attendees her deep understanding of how to build safer online communities.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nAt a time when much of tech is unwinding its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the interest of catering to the Trump administration\u2019s policies, Kissane\u2019s advice went in the opposite direction. She advised builders to actively seek out \u201cthe intelligent and informed perspectives of the most vulnerable people in groups that you\u2019re building for before and during rollouts and changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can keep the most vulnerable people safe, you can keep everyone safe,\u201d said Kissane.\n\nThese are not radical ideas but have become politically charged issues.\n\nAs the event concluded, some attendees left to immediately begin hacking on projects with connections they formed over the weekend. Promises to continue talking and connecting were made, and an active Discord chat filled with people who have now met in person.\n\n\u201cI go to a lot of events in [San Franscico],\u201d Tessa Brown, the co-founder of secure chat app Germ Network, told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like \u2026 everything started today, and everything is just the future. There\u2019s no lessons from the past.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, Brown added, \u201cEveryone here is just so thoughtful about how we got to this moment \u2026 It feels very different.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch reported from the ATmosphere Conference in Seattle, Washington."}
