But Levin, who has long served as the outfit\u2019s chief strategy officer, will do more than run the company as CEO; he will also maintain his other roles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been running R&D, and I think the CEO should be the chief product officer, so I\u2019m making no changes to our R&D leadership team; it will continue to report directly to me,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nLevin declined to provide more information about Gronager other than to say that Gronager is also no longer on the Chainalysis board but retains his equity in the company.\n\nA message to Gronager on Wednesday from TechCrunch went unreturned.\n\nAsked about Chainalysis\u2019 financial health, Levin said the startup is \u201ccontinuing to invest in our growth,\u201d and that \u201cwe don\u2019t need to raise capital. We raised $175 million in 2022 and [still] feel strong about the cash position of company.\u201d He added that his focus will be on \u201cexecuting, the expansion of our risk platform, and going deeper with our government clients across the world to ensure they can deal with the increased demand of crypto.\u201d\n\nChainalysis, whose early investors include Benchmark, was valued by investors at $8.6 billion during that 2022 funding round. Crypto investor Katie Haun, who first discovered Chainalysis in her capacity as federal prosecutor, reportedly began buying up secondary shares of the company at a valuation of $2.5 billion this past April.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The most obvious proof point: The price of bitcoin reached a record high of $100,000 on Wednesday.\n\nAbove: Levin at a StrictlyVC event hosted by TechCrunch in November 2024."}
