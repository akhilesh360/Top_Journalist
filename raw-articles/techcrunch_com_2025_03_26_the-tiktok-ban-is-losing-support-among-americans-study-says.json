While 22% of respondents opposed it in 2023, that population rose to 32% in the recent study.\n\nThese trends were consistent across party lines, with support for the ban among Republican and Republican-leaning voters dropping from 60% to 30% since March 2023. Across the aisle, support dropped from 43% to 30%.\n\nBut Americans who don\u2019t use TikTok were almost four times as likely to support the ban than those who do use the app \u2014 12% of TikTok users supported the ban, as opposed to 45% of non-users.\n\nThough the popularity of this legislation has waned, TikTok\u2019s fate in the U.S. remains uncertain.\n\nWith bipartisan support in the House and Senate, former President Joe Biden signed the TikTok ban into law last April, citing concerns about potential Chinese surveillance. This gave the Chinese TikTok owner ByteDance until January 19 \u2014 the day before the next presidential inauguration \u2014 to sell the app to an American company.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But American users were only blocked out for around 12 hours before the app came back online; President Trump postponed ByteDance\u2019s sale deadline another three months, until April 19.\n\nAmerican companies like Oracle, Microsoft, and Perplexity AI are rumored to have interest in buying TikTok, but ByteDance has not indicated that it plans to sell."}
