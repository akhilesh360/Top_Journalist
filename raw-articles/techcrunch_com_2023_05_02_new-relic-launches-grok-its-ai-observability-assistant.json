Today, New Relic is throwing its hat in the ring with New Relic Grok, which it calls the \u201cworld\u2019s first generative AI assistant for observability\u201d (and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last). Unsurprisingly, the idea here is to use a large language model to help engineers use natural language to perform many routine tasks in New Relic \u2014 think setting up instrumentation, building reports and managing accounts.\n\n\u201cObservability tools exist to serve the DevOps and DevSecOps movements. Engineers use observability tools to get the data they need to operate and secure the software they build,\u201d said New Relic Chief Product Officer Manav Khurana. \u201cThe reality, however, is that it\u2019s hard for every engineer to translate a question they have into a data model, sift through their tools to find the right data, and then translate data back to an insight in natural language. That\u2019s why DevSecOps practices are lagging behind all the innovation in Observability tooling. Now with Generative AI, there will be an explosion of new software developed in a completely different way, creating even more complexity to operate and secure software.\u201d\n\nA significant advantage of using these models is obviously to make it easier for engineers to analyze the large amounts of data that the service collects. As Khurana noted, these days, that means not just ensuring the performance of a given service but also the cost of running them, something that\u2019s now top of mind for most enterprises.\n\nWith Grok, engineers can sift through all of this data more easily and comb through their unified telemetry data without having to write complex queries. And while building dashboards and reports will surely be one main use case, Grok will also allow users to use queries like \u201cWhy is this service not working?\u201d and get to the root cause of a given problem and use CodeStream, the company\u2019s telemetry and collaboration service that can be integrated into popular IDEs, to debug code-level issues if needed.\n\n\u201cEver since we invented cloud APM in 2008, we have pioneered innovations years ahead of competitors. New Relic Grok is the continuation of this DNA and defines how generative AI will transform our industry,\u201d said New Relic CEO Bill Staples. \u201cDespite the collective progress, engineers are unable to realize the true potential of observability due to the complexity of manually analyzing troves of telemetry data emitted from increasingly complex software systems. New Relic Grok democratizes access to data and insight, and is a game-changer for organizations committed to building agile, innovative, and lasting businesses.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, New Relic also launched its MLOps observability platform, which allows engineering teams to monitor applications built with OpenAI\u2019s GPT APIs.\n\nGrok will soon be available in a limited preview."}
