He\u2019s launching his own startup, focused on a different problem for online shoppers: what he calls \u201ccheck-in.\u201d\n\nWhen you click on an ad for something like a T-shirt, the experience afterward can feel a little clunky. The website you land on might not even have the product you clicked on to begin with. That causes many shoppers to bounce back, hurting conversion rates, Kuruvilla told TechCrunch.\n\nKuruvilla wants to change that with AI. His new startup, Spangle AI, creates custom landing pages for shoppers based on what they searched for or clicked on. It sells to major retailers looking to better monetize their traffic and is powered by an AI model called ProductGPT that decodes customer interactions.\n\nBased in Seattle, Spangle AI raised a $6 million seed round last year, it told TechCrunch. Its investors include Seattle-based Madrona Ventures and Streamlined Ventures, which is in Silicon Valley.\n\nSpangle AI joins a host of other e-commerce startups who sell AI to customize online shopping experiences and improve conversions. Vancouver, B.C.,-based Unbounce, which sells no-code landing pages, raised almost $40 million in 2020 while Dubai-based Qeen.AI raised $10 million earlier this month for its smart shopping assistants.\n\nIt\u2019s still early in Spangle AI\u2019s journey, but the startup claims to be seeing promising signs from its product, which has boosted conversion rates by 51% in early testing. Armed with its product and these case studies, Spangle AI says it will now focus mostly on sales.\n\nKuruvilla was Bolt\u2019s CEO for two years and previously worked for almost eight years at Amazon. He replaced Bolt\u2019s outspoken co-founder Ryan Breslow in 2022 after Breslow\u2019s fiery Twitter tirade against Y Combinator.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Breslow has since returned as CEO, defended the loan as a vote of confidence in Bolt, and announced that Bolt\u2019s legal troubles are over.\n\nKuruvilla, who jokingly announced on X that he had \u201cone-click checked out\u201d from Bolt when he left last year, is looking ahead. \u201cI just love e-commerce and I love solving hard problems,\u201d he told TechCrunch."}
