The interactive feed acts as a storefront for brands where viewers can easily browse multiple products using their remotes. When a viewer selects an item, they\u2019re prompted to scan a QR code with their smartphone to get a direct link for purchase.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a button for viewers to press and hold, allowing them to send the link to their phones to shop for all the products at once.\n\nImage Credits:YouTube\n\nYouTube has become a dominant force in TV viewing. Nielsen reported that it has been the top platform for streaming watch time in the U.S. for over two years, surpassing streaming giants Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video. In the first quarter of 2025, TVs were the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S., according to internal data from the company.\n\nNotably, the company pointed to a Kantar survey, indicating that U.S. participants ranked YouTube as the No. 1 platform for seeking out information about brands. The company also said YouTube campaigns on CTV generated over 50 million monthly average conversions in the fourth quarter.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
