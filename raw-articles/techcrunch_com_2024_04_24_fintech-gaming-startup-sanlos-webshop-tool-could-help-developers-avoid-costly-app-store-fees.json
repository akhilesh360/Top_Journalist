Gaming companies can sign up for a demo starting today.\n\nWith Google and Apple charging a 30% fee for in-app purchases, it\u2019s more challenging than ever for small- to mid-size gaming companies to run profitable businesses. Gaming giant Epic has complained about Apple\u2019s revenue cut for years now, accusing it of being predatory toward smaller businesses.\n\nAs a result, many mobile game developers are no longer relying on app stores for monetization and are turning to external webshops, a rising trend in gaming where companies can run stores on their own websites for a much lower fee (around 4-10%). Plus, webshops are believed to boost revenue because players buy directly from the gaming company, as opposed to buying from app stores, which take a cut of sales. In fact, Sanlo said developers can earn up to 25% more revenue with a webshop.\n\n\u201cA webshop is one of those super tactical steps that actually proved to show that you can implement revenue from,\u201d Sanlo co-founder and CEO Olya Caliujnaia told TechCrunch. \u201cThe reason being that it\u2019s usually your most engaged, loyal players who go to the webshop and they get special offers that allow them to do better in the game.\u201d\n\nWith Sanlo\u2019s new webshop tool, game developers get a range of promotional mechanics like exclusive digital items, bundle packs, discounted offers and loyalty programs to incentivize more players to try the game. Developers can also access player data so they can monitor profiles and purchase activity in order to target individual users with compelling offers.\n\nCompanies can test and set pricing \u201cwith no price caps,\u201d according to Sanlo. Earnings from webshop sales are deposited into the developer\u2019s account once a week.\n\nOne downside about webstores is that Apple and Google don\u2019t let mobile games advertise them in-app. Sanlo offers marketing tools as a solution to this issue, such as in-game prompts to promote the webshop, sending emails to returning visitors and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) attribution tracking.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company\u2019s team touts previous experience at Capital One, Earnest, Electronic Arts, Facebook, SigFig, Sony PlayStation, Visa and more.\n\nTo date, the company has raised $13.5 million in total funding, and is backed by Initial Capital, Index Ventures, Portage Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital, London Venture Partners and Konvoy.\n\nWebstore solutions have existed for years now, from more established companies like Xsolla to newer entrants like Appcharge. Popular games leveraging webshops include Clash of Clans, Game of Thrones: Conquest, Marvel Strike Force and Star Trek Fleet Command."}
