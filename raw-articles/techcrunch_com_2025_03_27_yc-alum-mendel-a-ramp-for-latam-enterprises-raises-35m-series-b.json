With this latest capital infusion, the startup has brought in a total of $60 million in equity funding and $50 million via a credit facility.\n\nMendel\u2019s mission is straightforward: to reinvent corporate spend management by automating most of the operations for an enterprise CFO that are currently done manually. Or put even more simply, it wants to be a one-stop shop for all B2B spend. Its offering integrates expense management, payments, and corporate travel.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to give CFOs and finance teams in Latin America real-time visibility and control over their spend \u2014 be it employee expenses, vendor payments, or business travel bookings,\u201d said co-CEO and co-founder Alan Karpovsky.\n\nKarpovsky and Alejandro Zecler (who both previously founded and sold other startups) started Mendel in early 2021, and Helena Polyblank (CPO) and Gonzalo Castiglione (CTO) later joined as co-founders.\n\nMendel declined to reveal valuation, with Karpovsky saying only the round reflected \u201ca significant step up\u201d from the company\u2019s previous raise. The company also declined to reveal hard revenue figures, with Karpovsky noting only that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew almost 2.5x year-over-year, with gross margins of over 75%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not yet profitable, but we anticipate reaching profitability by late 2025,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Its revenue comes from a combination of SaaS fees (over 50%) for its expense management and travel tool and interchange fees from credit cards as well as a take rate from its bill pay product.\n\nKarpovsky believes that the company\u2019s LatAm focus gives it an advantage over other global players in that it\u2019s able to address \u201ccomplex, country-specific regulations\u201d such as tax codes, invoicing requirements, and multi-currency workflows, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe like to say \u2018Mendel is like SAP Concur and AMEX having a child,\u2019 Karpovsky quipped.\n\nAs for comparisons to New York-based decacorn Ramp, he said that in many ways, \u201cMendel is like Ramp for Latin American enterprises\u201d with a few differentiators, including the fact that it is focused on \u201clarge, complex organizations that require multi-entity, multi-currency, multi-credit-line and deep ERP integrations.\u201d\n\nPresently, Mendel has 80 employees, compared to 64 employees a year ago. Looking ahead, the company plans to expand geographically. It\u2019s already operating in Mexico and Argentina with about 500 customers, including Mercado Libre, FEMSA, Adecco, and McDonald\u2019s. It\u2019s looking to expand into Chile, Colombia, and Peru in 2025, and Brazil in 2026.\n\n\u201cOur approach from day zero was first consolidating the largest Spanish-speaking market in LatAm before starting the geo-expansion,\u201d Karpovsky said.\n\nBase10 Partner Jason Kong told TechCrunch that his firm was attracted to what it viewed as Mendel\u2019s \u201cunique positioning\u201d as a spend management platform for large companies in underserved \u2014 but growing \u2014 Latin America.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s high capital efficiency \u2014 being cash-flow positive in December 2024 \u2014 stood out in a sector where many players struggle with unit economics,\u201d Kong added. \u201cAdditionally, Mendel\u2019s ability to replace legacy solutions like SAP Concur and win large enterprise customers at a fast sales velocity (sub-3 months for 3,000+ employee enterprises) demonstrated clear product-market fit.\u201d Other companies also operating in this space in Latin America include Clara and Jeeves \u2014 another YC alum \u2014 but both target more SMBs and rely more on transactional fees, noted Kong."}
