Competitors include Celestia and EigenLayer, which are also focused on modularity.\n\nModularity allows developers to choose the components they will use to build a blockchain system or application. Like customizing orders in a restaurant, developers will be able to configure the components to best suit their needs.\n\n\u201cOur goal is we can now enable any blockchain to be as performant and inexpensive as a web2 application,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of having this modularity approach.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum, for example, is a monolithic blockchain. This means there\u2019s a data layer, consensus layer and functions done by only one blockchain. It can\u2019t be pulled apart, making it hard to customize. And in order to have the centralized AI technologies that exist today involved, this core infrastructure needs to be built, Heinrich said.\n\nWhen co-founders Heinrich, Ming Wu, Fan Long and Thomas Yao initially got together, they had conversations with other market players and found there was a \u201cclear market signal that this aspect of data availability and data storage is really critical, not only to scale blockchain systems, but to make on-chain AI even a possibility,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cThere was infrastructure that\u2019s missing, and we had a strong commitment to build that.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And the data pipeline needs to be broad enough that many users can use it at a time. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we enable: the scalability and storage of models so that we can then partner with others who do the execution layer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe investor community realized this was a key unlock for the space so we got a number of term sheets very quickly,\u201d Heinrich said. \u201cOnce we chose our lead as Hack VC, the floodgates opened up and we got 20x oversubscribed. We had over $100 million in interest and partnered with the investors who we thought could help us the most.\u201d\n\nInvestors from over 40 crypto-native institutions also joined in, including Alliance, Animoca Brands, Delphi Digital, Stanford Builders Fund, Symbolic Capital and OKX Ventures, to name a few. 0G declined to disclose its valuation.\n\nThe large distributed cap table is in line with web3 values, Heinrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s a community-driven ethos and effort, and that\u2019s why we decided we should take in more capital as a result to have the right partners.\u201d\n\nThe initial capital will be used to hire engineers and build up 0G\u2019s market functionality, community and ecosystem.\n\nAnd as of right now, 0G doesn\u2019t have its own token, but \u201cit is a web3 company,\u201d Heinrich said, \u201cso we will release a token in the future, but can\u2019t say more at the moment.\u201d\n\nA focus on high throughput\n\nThe chain claims that it will be extremely fast and cheap compared to competitors. The goal is to focus on high security and throughput, which is the ability for the network to process a lot of transactions within a certain time frame, on its chain. Its throughput will be 50 Gbps, compared to competitor rates of 1.5 MBps, he said.\n\nOn-chain AI and gaming requires a fast data pipeline. Without fast and efficient throughput, costs can add up. The current one is \u201cnot fast enough, so we built an ultra-high-performance data pipeline,\u201d Heinrich said.\n\nOver time, it wants to reach \u201cinfinite capacity;\u201d similar to how Amazon\u2019s web server lets developers spin up as many servers as they need, 0G wants to spin up as many consensus networks as possible. A consensus network brings all of a blockchain\u2019s nodes together and in agreement on one data set.\n\nReaching new use cases\n\nOnce the chain is fully operational and on mainnet, which means it\u2019s a functional, public blockchain, any Web 2.0 application can be built on-chain, Heinrich said. The company plans to launch on mainnet by the third quarter of this year.\n\nHeinrich sees the ideal initial ecosystem members and users as layer 2 blockchains like Polygon and Arbitrum, which focus on scaling the Ethereum ecosystem, as well as high-performance teams that are building decentralized applications that require high bandwidth and plan on bringing in hundreds of millions of users.\n\nIt also plans to enable new use cases and things that were not possible before, like on-chain AI, on-chain gaming and high-frequency decentralized finance (DeFi). 0G claims that the gas costs, or fees, per transaction are \u201cessentially negligible at this point.\u201d\n\nThis will, in turn, allow for more AI applications to evolve and bigger issues to be addressed on-chain.\n\nIn the near term, it plans to capitalize on a lot of use cases and support \u201cthings that are difficult to solve\u201d ranging from deepfake detection on the AI side to building decentralized models and helping high-performant use cases on the blockchain side.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be a public good and serve humanity and it can take many different shapes or forms,\u201d Heinrich said."}
