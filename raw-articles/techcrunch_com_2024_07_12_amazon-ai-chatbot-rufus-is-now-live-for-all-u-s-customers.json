The assistant, which lives on the bottom right of the app\u2019s main navigation bar, is designed to offer customers help with finding products, performing product comparisons and getting recommendations on what to buy.\n\nRufus was initially available in beta only to select customers in the U.S. within the Amazon mobile app ahead of Friday\u2019s launch. Now, Amazon says all shoppers in the U.S. can try it after testing the chatbot across \u201ctens of millions of questions.\u201d\n\nFirst announced in February, the AI chatbot has been trained on Amazon\u2019s product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As and other public information found around the web \u2014 though Amazon isn\u2019t disclosing specifically which websites\u2019 data was used to help its assistant make better recommendations, or whether that included other retail websites.\n\nRufus itself is powered by an internal large language model (LLM) specialized for shopping, allowing customers to ask questions about products, including things like factors to consider when buying, how items are different from other products, or how well the product holds up, as described by customer reviews and other expert analysis pulled from around the web.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nFor example, customers could ask things like \u201cWhat to consider when buying headphones?\u201d \u201cWhat to consider when detailing my car at home?\u201d \u201cWhat are clean beauty products?\u201d \u201cWhat do I need for cold weather golf?\u201d and more. Plus, customers can chat with Rufus, by telling the AI something they want to do, like: \u201cI want to start an indoor garden.\u201d The chatbot will then provide suggestions on what to buy to accomplish that task.\n\nDuring tests, Amazon found that customers asked the AI questions and were also clicking on the related questions that appear in the chat window to help guide customer queries. For instance, customers might ask Rufus, \u201cWhat\u2019s the material of the backpack?,\u201d and then tap on another question, \u201cWhat do customers say?\u201d to learn more.\n\nImage Credits:Amazon\n\nBecause Rufus understands more than just products, when a customer asked about a pool umbrella for Florida, Rufus shared facts about Florida\u2019s weather, humidity and more, Amazon says.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

However, it didn\u2019t always get its facts right, and its limitations to only Amazon\u2019s catalog \u2014 vast as it is \u2014 could compromise the quality of its recommendations, at times.\n\nAmazon says it will continue to improve Rufus over time."}
