CEO Han Wang says that the proceeds will be put toward product development and doubling Mintlify\u2019s core three-person team by the end of the year.\n\nIthaca, New York-based Mintlify was co-founded in 2021 by Han Wang and Hahnbee Lee \u2014 both software engineers by trade. Wang previously co-launched Foodful, a startup that developed a cloud-based monitoring system for cows, and Pe\u2022ple, an online customer community platform that was acquired by Tribe in early 2021. Lee was a co-founder at Pe\u2022ple before briefly joining Duolingo as an engineer.\n\nWang said the idea for Mintlify came from his and Lee\u2019s experiences in software development, which involved working with documentation that wasn\u2019t always complete or of the highest quality. Their observations agree with a 2017 GitHub survey, which found that 93% of developers consider incomplete or outdated documentation to be a pervasive problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked as software engineers at companies in all stages ranging from startups to Big Tech and found that they all suffer from bad documentation, if it even existed at all,\u201d Wang told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cDocumentation is the lifeline for junior engineers and those jumping into new codebases. It helps senior devs save time from explaining their code to others in the future. For public-facing and open source products, documentation has a direct impact on user adoption.\u201d\n\nMintlify aims to address the challenges around documentation with automation, specifically auto-generating documentation. The company\u2019s platform reads code and creates docs to explain it, leveraging technologies including natural language processing and web scraping.\n\nWang declined to reveal more about Mintlify\u2019s technical underpinnings, but generating documentation from code is well within the realm of possibility with today\u2019s AI techniques. That\u2019s evidenced by the fact that Mintlify has several competitors taking similar approaches, including Documatic, whose AI system automatically generates change logs and explanations from code in addition to documentation.\n\nWang asserts that Mintlify provides \u201csignificantly\u201d higher quality results than its rivals, and \u2014 unlike some \u2014 doesn\u2019t force developers to host documentation on a cloud service. \u201cMintlify\u2019s mission is to solve documentation rot by developing continuous documentation into a standard practice for software teams,\u201d Wang added. \u201c[W]hen engineering managers are actively seeking solutions for better documentation practices \u2026 that\u2019s when we step in.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

(Wang emphasized that the platform doesn\u2019t store code and encrypts all user data at rest and in transit.) Mintlify, which is free for individual developers, also integrates with existing systems including Slack, Dropbox and GitHub for automating task management and development workflows.\n\nAccording to Wang, adoption of Mintlify\u2019s free plan has been growing 20% every week since its January launch. With the user base now eclipsing 6,000 active accounts, the company plans to shift its focus to a premium offering oriented toward enterprise customers.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic standardized a decentralized and asynchronous work environment. This made high-quality documentation critical to achieving efficient communication, onboarding and product development,\u201d Wang said. \u201cOur expansion into workflow automations is addressing the challenge by targeting the engineering managers with our existing fanbase serving as champions.\u201d"}
