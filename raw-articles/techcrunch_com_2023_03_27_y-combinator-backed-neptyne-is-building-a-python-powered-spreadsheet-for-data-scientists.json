Data science tools like Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks do, but they tend to be too inaccessible to the layperson \u2014 at least in Osinga and Amadeo\u2019s experience.\n\n\u201cTalk to any analyst or financial modeler and they\u2019ll tell you that Excel just doesn\u2019t cut it anymore,\u201d Osinga said. \u201cEverybody is aware of the need to move to more powerful solutions and Python is the obvious candidate. Yet collaborating with today\u2019s tools is underwhelming.\u201d\n\nOsinga and Amadeo\u2019s solution was Neptyne, an app that uses an AI assistant to help users program spreadsheets without learning how to code. A member of the Y Combinator winter 2023 class, Neptyne this month closed a $2 million pre-seed round from Y Combinator and a group of high-profile angels, including Google AI lead Jeff Dean and Google Maps co-founder Lars Rasmussen.\n\nNeptyne joins a raft of startups on a mission to transform the traditional spreadsheet. There\u2019s Airtable, of course, plus upstarts like Spreadsheet.com, Actiondesk and Pigment \u2014 the last of which raised $73 million last November for its data analytics and visualization service. Most recently, Equals, a San Francisco-based venture, raised $16 million for its spreadsheet platform that incorporates tools like live data integrations.\n\nNeptyne is different in that it packs a Python-based spreadsheet engine, Python being the programming language popularly used for data science. Osinga describes it thusly: It\u2019s a spreadsheet where everything works the way you\u2019d expect it to work in a spreadsheet, but that also offers access to the Python ecosystem \u2014 including libraries, frameworks and tools.\n\n\u201cThe large language models [like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4] that have recently produced mind-blowing results happen to be very good at writing Python code,\u201d Osinga said. \u201cSince Neptyne natively speaks Python, it means that the AI doesn\u2019t just help you write formulas or visualize data \u2014 you can have a dialog with the AI about the spreadsheet application in front of you and have it modify it for you.\u201d\n\nFor example, imagine you have a pivot table built using Pandas, an open source Python library for data analysis, that summarizes data both by product and region. With Neptyne, you can ask the AI assistant to modify the pivot table calculation to include or exclude products or change the grouping criteria, such as by product category instead of individual product. Neptyne updates the calculations in real time, allowing you to explore different options.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cA lot of important modeling and calculations today is hidden in complex spreadsheets or data processing systems and modifying requires experts to dig in deep,\u201d Osinga said. \u201cNeptyne\u2019s powerful AI integrations eliminate the limitations of normal spreadsheets while dramatically reducing the complexity of using advanced data tools.\u201d\n\nThem\u2019s fighting words. But it\u2019s early days for Neptyne \u2014 the company is pre-revenue and isn\u2019t disclosing the size of its customer base. Osinga optimistically expects growth this year, so much so that he\u2019s anticipating hiring six staffers to round out Neptyne\u2019s current four-person workforce."}
