AWS IoT TwinMaker also provides a framework for you to create your own data connectors to use with other data sources (such as Snowflake and Siemens MindSphere),\u201d AWS explained in a blog post about the new service.\n\nThe company notes that once the digital twin graph is created, users will likely want to visualize the data in the context of the physical environment. To address this, AWS IoT TwinMaker creates a digital twin graph that combines the relationships between virtual representations of users\u2019 physical systems and connected data sources. This allows users to accurately model their real-world environment. Users can also import existing 3D models to arrange 3D scenes of physical space, such as a factory. From there, you can also add interactive video and sensor data overlays along with insights from connected machine learning services.\n\nAWS notes that the service comes with a plugin for Amazon Managed Grafana, which is a managed service for the open dashboard and visualization platform from Grafana Labs.\n\nAWS IoT TwinMaker is available today in preview in Northern Virginia, Oregon, Ireland and Singapore, with availability in additional AWS Regions to come."}
