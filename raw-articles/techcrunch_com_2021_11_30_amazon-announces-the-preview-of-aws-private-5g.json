The launch is meant to address the challenges companies are facing with leveraging 5G. AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said that with AWS Private 5G, you can set up and scale a private mobile network in days instead of months.\n\n\u201cYou get all the goodness of mobile technology without the pain of long planning cycles, complex integrations and the high upfront costs,\u201d Selipsky stated during the company\u2019s keynote. \u201cYou tell us where you want to build your network and specify the network capacity. We ship you all the required hardware, the software and the SIM cards.\u201d\n\nSelipsky outlined that AWS Private 5G automates the setup and deployment of the network and scales capacity on-demand to support additional devices and increased network traffic. There are no upfront fees or per-device costs with AWS Private 5G, and customers pay only for the network capacity and throughput they request.\n\n\u201cCustomers want to build their own private 5G networks to address these limitations, but private mobile network deployments require customers to invest considerable time, money and effort to design their network for anticipated peak capacity, and procure and integrate software and hardware components from multiple vendors. Even if customers are able to get the network running, current private mobile network pricing models charge for each connected device and make it cost prohibitive for use cases that involve thousands of connected devices,\u201d the company said in a blog post about the new service.\n\nAmazon outlines that AWS Private 5G simplifies deployment allowing customers to deploy their own 4G/LTE or 5G quickly, scale up and down the number of connected devices rapidly and benefit from a familiar on-demand cloud pricing model."}
