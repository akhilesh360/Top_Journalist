The deal reflects Netflix\u2019s rising star and arguably acceptance by the legendary director of a new order to the cinematic world where home viewing is a first-class citizen.\n\nThe deal was announced in a press release with few details except glowing quotes from Amblin and Netflix executives. All that is certain is that Amblin will produce \u201cmultiple new feature films per year\u201d for Netflix.\n\n\u201cFrom the minute Ted [Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,\u201d said Spielberg in the release.\n\nThose new ways didn\u2019t sound so amazing to Spielberg a couple years ago when he was reportedly pushing to exclude Netflix films from the Academy Awards.\n\n\u201cOnce you commit to a television format, you\u2019re a TV movie,\u201d Spielberg told ITV in March of 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.\u201d\n\nUltimately no real push was made, though. Whether Spielberg was misrepresented, changed his mind or just read the room, he has since tempered his position. He has said rather that he simply wants to cherish and protect \u201cthe theatrical experience\u201d \u2014 understandable from one of the pioneers of the modern blockbuster.\n\nNaturally it\u2019s a huge get for Netflix, which will get a steady stream of Amblin features, though there\u2019s no guarantee of a Spielberg picture. Meanwhile Amblin will continue its longtime partnership with Universal, which fills the more traditional moviemaking and distribution side of things. The company has already broken bread with streaming companies, with shows and films made for and distributed by Netflix and others, but this is most significant partnership so far.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In a world where the \u201ctheatrical experience\u201d is a potential superspreader event and people are perfectly happy to watch (and pay for) a \u201cpremiere\u201d at home, it may be better to roll with the punches and hope that things bounce back."}
