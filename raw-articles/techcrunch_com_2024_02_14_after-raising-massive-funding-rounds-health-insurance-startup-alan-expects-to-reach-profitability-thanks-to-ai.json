A few years ago, the startup\u2019s office was limited to one floor in a nondescript office building near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris.\n\nOver time, the company added another floor, then another floor \u2014 now the company of 550 employees also occupies the top floor of the building. It\u2019s a common area with a kitchen in a corner and a beautiful view of Paris\u2019 typical gray zinc rooftops.\n\nThis morning, Alan\u2019s co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve and its chief revenue officer, Ludovic Baupl\u00e9, held a press conference with a group of reporters. Some of them cover tech startups, while others focus on the insurance industry. It\u2019s an unusual mix of reporters but that\u2019s because Alan is an unusual company.\n\nThe company originally started with a health insurance product that complements the national healthcare system in France. French companies must provide a health insurance product to all their employees when they join. Today, over 500,000 people are covered by Alan\u2019s insurance product.\n\nImage Credits:Romain Dillet / TechCrunch\n\nBut Alan is also a tech company that has raised quite a few funding rounds. With its most recent \u20ac183 million Series E funding round ($196 million at today\u2019s exchange rate), the company reached a valuation of \u20ac2.7 billion ($2.9 billion).\n\nAlan has integrated and automated as many things as possible for its core product, the insurance part. It has also expanded to other services so that its app can be a sort of a one-stop shop for all things related to your health.\n\nAfter years of explosive growth, the French tech ecosystem has slowed down with funding drying up and many companies looking for a quick exit \u2014 unless you\u2019re working for a generative AI company. As Alan is one of the biggest private tech companies in France, it\u2019s interesting to keep a close eye on the company to understand how it sees the future.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In 2023 alone, the company reported $63 million in losses (\u20ac59 million).\n\nBut things are improving. Last year, 5,000 companies became new clients. In France, Alan is no longer the hip health insurance company for tech startups, as new clients include Celio, Duracell, Mantu, and Clinitex, as well as the employees of France\u2019s National Assembly.\n\nAlan also operates in Belgium and Spain. And the difference is quite clear in Spain, for instance, as Alan names N26, Cabify and Eventbrite as new clients in the country \u2014 in other words, tech companies with local teams in Spain.\n\n\u201cProfitability is a core topic for us. Our goal has been to reach profitability in 2025 for France. And we are confirming it once again,\u201d Baupl\u00e9 said. As for other markets, the company says that it expects to be profitable as a whole in 2026.\n\n\u201cOur cash position is more than \u20ac180 million. Our solvency ratio is now 450%, which is well above the minimum requirement and twice the market average,\u201d Baupl\u00e9 added.\n\nImage Credits:Romain Dillet / TechCrunch\n\nDoes it mean that Alan is done with funding rounds? This part is a bit unclear, as it has become much harder to raise late-stage rounds at high valuations. Things could change. And of course, never say never.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to raise a new round to stay on plan and maintain this growth rate until we reach profitability,\u201d Samuelian-Werve said later in the conversation. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019ve received unsolicited offers from investors in the past . . . we\u2019ll continue to look at them, but today that\u2019s not really our strategy.\u201d\n\nGrowing revenue, not costs\n\nAlan\u2019s path to profitability includes growing the company\u2019s bottom line without necessarily growing much as a team. Right now, Alan has a gross margin of 10% after deducting all health reimbursements. But if you include all expenses, the net margin becomes negative at \u201317%.\n\nIn 2024, Alan expects to grow its revenue by 40%. But the company only plans to hire 30 people \u2014 a modest 5% increase in its workforce.\n\nThat\u2019s because Alan\u2019s service has been designed to scale well without necessarily adding more people. It\u2019s a self-serve app and service. Reimbursements are automated as much as possible with optical character recognition, a fraud engine that has been developed in-house, automated bank transfers, etc.\n\nPreventive care in the app is also a big part of Alan\u2019s offering with a focus on eight different topics ranging from mental health to back pain. This part is mostly handled by a library of videos and 80 health professionals who partner with Alan to answer questions via a messaging interface.\n\nAlan also says that artificial intelligence is going to be key when it comes to scaling. Like with many customer support teams today, some of the interactions between Alan\u2019s customers and its team are optimized by artificial intelligence.\n\nBut all teams leverage artificial intelligence in one way or another. Alan CEO Samuelian-Werve told me that every employee is now 40% more productive.\n\nThey get meeting reports much faster thanks to automatic transcriptions and LLM-powered summaries. They use Dust to query AI assistants with the team\u2019s data. Developers can iterate faster thanks to AI copilots.\n\nSamuelian-Werve also happens to be a non-executive co-founder and board member of Mistral AI, France\u2019s much talked about foundational model maker. In fact, Mistral AI\u2019s office is located in the same building as Alan\u2019s office.\n\nWhile it\u2019s harder to raise massive funding rounds in France, artificial intelligence might appear as an alternative to ever-growing teams at Big Tech companies like Alan.\n\nThat might not work for every tech company, as Alan\u2019s internal culture is quite peculiar. Everything is written down and fully transparent with regular check-ins from teammates. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a pragmatical example of the real-world impact of artificial intelligence on the financial outlook of a tech company at the growth stage."}
