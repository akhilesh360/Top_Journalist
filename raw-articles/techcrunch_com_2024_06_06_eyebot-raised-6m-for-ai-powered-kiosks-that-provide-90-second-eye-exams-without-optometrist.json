While there isn\u2019t a shortage of low-cost and luxury frames available online or in stores, consumers can only buy them with a current eyeglass prescription.\n\nThat means they first need a vision exam from an optometrist to receive that prescription. But due to a nationwide shortage of eye care practitioners, it may take weeks, especially in rural areas, to get an appointment.\n\nEyebot, a new startup coming out of stealth on Thursday, wants to reduce the time it takes to receive a vision exam to about 90 seconds without the direct involvement of an optometrist. Starting in October, the Boston-based company will roll out its self-serve, vision-testing terminals in shopping centers, grocery stores and pharmacies in New England.\n\nAnyone who wants to have their vision checked can walk up to Eyebot\u2019s five-ish-foot kiosk and press a button, and the company\u2019s computer vision technology will automatically scan the person\u2019s eyes, extracting the eyeglass or contact lens prescription. (While Eyebot can\u2019t perform initial fittings of contact lenses, it can update an existing prescription.)\n\nEyebot\u2019s founder and CEO Matthias Hofmann said he developed similar technology 10 years ago at EyeNetra, a startup that used smartphones to test eyesight. EyeNetra went out of business several years ago, according to Hofmann, who worked there as the leading engineer until 2015.\n\n\u201cWe realized that using smartphones is not actually the solution,\u201d said Hofmann, who, before joining EyeNetra, was a postdoctoral researcher in mammography at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhat people want is a fully automated experience where they don\u2019t have to learn or do anything complicated. Our technology now allows people to simply stand in front of our units.\u201d\n\nEyebot-generated prescriptions are finalized by teledoctors within 24 hours, and consumers who want to purchase glasses from any retailer must pay $30 for an exam. But if they purchase glasses from one of Eyebot\u2019s partner brands, the vision exam is free. The technology is registered with the FDA, Hofmann said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Once a shopper finalizes their exam, they can choose to buy eyeglasses from that brand directly on a touchscreen within the kiosk or by using their smartphone. Eyebot plans to make money by partnering with these eyewear brands and taking a commission on each sale.\n\n\u201cRetailers are looking for new channels to reach the customers,\u201d Hofmann said. \u201cNow they have an opportunity to show their brand in CVS, Walgreens, Stop and Shop, Kroger and on college campuses.\u201d\n\nEyebot is close to finalizing partnership agreements with several large eyeglass and contact lens merchants, Hofmann said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very lucrative model. The demand for what we\u2019re doing is very high.\u201d\n\nDemand for investing in Eyebot\u2019s seed round was high, too, according to Hofmann. On Thursday, the company announced a $6 million funding round led by AlleyCorp and Ubiquity Ventures with participation from Humba Ventures, Village Global, Baukunst, Ravelin, and Spacecadet.\n\nThe capital will be used for expansion to other geographies."}
