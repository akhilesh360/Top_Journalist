LOOM\u2019s founder Erica Chidi will join Perelel as a strategic advisor.\n\nChidi co-launched LOOM in 2017 as an in-person experience, offering women educational content about reproductive and sexual health education. By 2020, it expanded into an online subscription digital platform, providing courses, content, and community support to women. It raised a total of $6.5 million from investors like Slow Ventures, and Founders Fund, as well as celebrities such as actress Tessa Thompson and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\n\u201cI was like, the 34th Black woman to raise over a million dollars in venture capital,\u201d Chidi recalled to TechCrunch, adding that she didn\u2019t expect she would raise the nearly $3 million in three months back in late 2019. \u201cAt the moment, there was just a new interest in women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Taylor, Dr. Banafsheh Bayati, and Victoria Thain Gioia launched Perelel in 2020 to offer clinically-backed vitamins to support women\u2019s hormonal health. The company says it has grown its product portfolio by 50% year-over-year, says it has sold more than 48 million capsules since its launch, with overall growth hitting more than 120% year-over-year, although it declined to disclose revenue. It closed a $6 million Series A led by Unilever in February.\n\nThe past few years have seen the topic of women\u2019s health thrown into the sociopolitical spotlight, particularly since the Supreme Court overturned national access to abortion in the U.S.\n\nPerelel hormonal products, courtesy of Perelel\n\nThain Gioia, who is co-CEO alongside Taylor, remembers Perelel\u2019s pre-launch when investors were asking them how big the women\u2019s health market was for fertility, pregnancy, and postpartum, believing it was a small opportunity for returns. \u201cThe positive of today is that, at least from the investor community, they\u2019re actually realizing that women\u2019s health is a huge underserved opportunity for all of us to tackle,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\n\nThe numbers indeed show some healthy growth, though all companies in recent years \u2014 unless they are AI \u2014 are still seeing some trouble in the funding environment. A 2023 report by Silicon Valley Bank found that there has been a 314% increase in venture dollars flowing to women\u2019s health companies since 2018 compared to a 28% increase for the overall health sector. Billions are flowing into the sector: Deloitte found that 2% of venture dollars into the health sector went to women\u2019s health companies, hitting $41.2 billion in 2023.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Chidi wanted to sell LOOM.\n\n\u201cOnce we launched our app in the App Store last October, I knew I wanted to move forward and ideally find a company that had a higher clinical acuity \u2014 or a higher consumer acuity \u2014 and could use what we built to better support women in a more 360 way,\u201d Chidi said.\n\n\u201cThis type of intentional education and health information and content isn\u2019t really bucketed together in any other brand within the category,\u201d Thain Gioia said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be creating something very different, but from two very strong existing brands.\n\nPerelel says its next steps are to continue its \u201cbroader mission of supporting women and supporting women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nLOOM had scaled its team back over the past few months and by the time the acquisition finished this week, Chidi was the only employee left. She says she\u2019s not one for idle hands and, aside from coming on as an advisor to Perelel, she\u2019s working as a consultant for other brands at the moment, including Nike. She wrote a book ten years ago and is working on an anniversary edition. \u201cMore time to write would be really nice,\u201d she said.\n\nThis piece was updated to reflect to whom Chidi would become an advisor."}
