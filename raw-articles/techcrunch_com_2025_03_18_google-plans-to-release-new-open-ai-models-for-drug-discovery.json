TechCrunch reached out to the company for more information and will update if the company responds.\n\nCountless companies, including Google spin-out Isomorphic Labs, have promised that AI could one day revolutionize drug discovery by dramatically accelerating the earliest R&D steps. While there have been some successes, AI has not provided an immediate magical solution in the lab.\n\nSeveral firms employing AI for drug discovery, including Exscientia and BenevolentAI, have suffered high-profile clinical trial failures in recent years. Meanwhile, the accuracy of leading AI systems for drug discovery, like Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold 3, tends to vary widely.\n\nStill, big pharma \u2014 and investors \u2014 appear to be enthusiastic about the tech\u2019s potential. In January, Isomorphic, which has partnerships with pharma giants Eli Lilly and Novartis, said that it expects testing on its AI-designed drugs to begin sometime this year. By one estimate, more than 460 AI startups are working on drug discovery, and investors have poured $60 billion into the space so far."}
