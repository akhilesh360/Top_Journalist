Temasek and existing investors Prosus Ventures, RTP Global, Sequoia Capital India and FMO also participated in the new round, which brings its to-date raise to $161 million ($157 million of that has arrived in the last 30 months).\n\nDeHaat, which is Hindi for village, is addressing three of the biggest challenges farmers face in India (and elsewhere): working capital, securing agri-input items such as seeds and fertilizers, and finding buyers after producing the yields. Only about a third of the yield Indian farmers produce reaches the big markets.\n\nThe Gurgaon and Patna-headquartered startup has brought to one platform brands that sell agri-input products, institutional financers and buyers. It also works with microentrepreneurs \u2014 more than 3,000 of them \u2014 to provide last-mile aggregation and delivery.\n\nThe startup, which runs a helpline to engage with farmers, also operates an eponymous Android app that is accessible in multiple languages.\n\n\u201cThe uniqueness of its full-stack approach combined with the \u2018phygital\u2019 go-to-market strategy further reaffirmed our view that the company is on track to become a significant player in the farming industry in India,\u201d said Yana Kachurina, principal at Sofina, in a statement.\n\nDeHaat said it serves over 650,000 farmers in Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and Odisha. On its platform, it offers more than 850 unique agribusinesses.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

India\u2019s agri-tech industry has the potential to reach about $24 billion in revenue by 2025, according to EY.\n\nAmazon recently began offering real-time advice and information to farmers to help them inform their decisions on crops. Microsoft is working with 100 villages to deploy AI and build a platform.\n\n\u201cOur team has grown to a brigade of 850+ professionals with deep expertise of growth and strategy, supply chain, technology and agricultural science,\u201d Kumar said, adding that the startup is also looking to hire more talent."}
