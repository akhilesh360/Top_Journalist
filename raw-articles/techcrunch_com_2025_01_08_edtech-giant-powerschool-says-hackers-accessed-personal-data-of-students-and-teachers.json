PowerSchool says its software is used by over 18,000 customers to support more than 60 million students in the United States.\n\nIn a letter sent to affected customers on Tuesday and published in a local news report, PowerSchool said it identified on December 28 that hackers successfully breached its PowerSource customer support portal, allowing further access to the company\u2019s school information system, PowerSchool SIS, which schools use to manage student records, grades, attendance, and enrollment. The letter said the company\u2019s investigation found the hackers gained access \u201cusing a compromised credential.\u201d\n\nPowerSchool has not said what types of data were accessed during the incident or how many individuals are affected by the breach.\n\nPowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler confirmed the incident in an email to TechCrunch but declined to answer specific questions about the incident. Bain Capital has responded to TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cWe have taken all appropriate steps to prevent the data involved from further unauthorized access or misuse,\u201d Keebler said. \u201cThe incident is contained and we do not anticipate the data being shared or made public. PowerSchool is not experiencing, nor expects to experience, any operational disruption and continues to provide services as normal to our customers.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the cyberattack remains unknown. Bleeping Computer reports that in an FAQ sent to affected users, PowerSchool said it did not experience a ransomware attack, but that the company was extorted into paying a financial sum to prevent the hackers from leaking the stolen data. PowerSchool told the publication that names and addresses were exposed in the breach, but that the information may also include Social Security numbers, medical information, grades, and other personally identifiable information. PowerSchool did not say how much the company paid.\n\nPowerSchool was sued by class action in November 2024, which alleges the company illegally sells student data without consent for commercial gain. According to the lawsuit, the company\u2019s troves of student data totals some \u201c345 terabytes of data collected from 440 school districts.\u201d\n\n\u201cPowerSchool collects this highly sensitive information under the guise of educational support, but in fact collects it for its own commercial gain,\u201d while hiding behind \u201copaque terms of service such that no one can understand,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nUpdated with comment from PowerSchool.\n\nDo you have more information about the PowerSchool data breach?
