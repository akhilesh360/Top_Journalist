We\u2019re not properly assessing the risks involved with playing God, we\u2019re not telling the public what we\u2019re working on and we\u2019re not even sure why we\u2019re messing with the science. (\u201cWe\u201d being the scientists involved.) What\u2019s worse is that, since we basically have no idea what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not sure if these tiny little wonders will affect the body any more or less than other, non-nanotechnologically-derived products. That\u2019s what the National Research Council said yesterday, at any rate.\n\nThe NRC report is a warning to American scientists and layman alike: \u201cFigure out where you\u2019re working on before you dive head first, all wily nily, into something no one understands yet.\u201d\n\nJust a fun reminder that, yeah, people of all shapes and sizes, of all creeds and backgrounds, can be horribly irresponsible."}
