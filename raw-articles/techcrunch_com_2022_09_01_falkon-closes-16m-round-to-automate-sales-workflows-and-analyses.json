CEO Mona Akmal says that the new money \u2014 which brings the company\u2019s total raised to $20 million \u2014 will be used to build integrations with workflow partners, support product research and expand the size of Falkon\u2019s team from 20 to 30 employees by the end of the year.\n\nAkmal started Falkon in 2020 alongside Josh Zana and Aakash Kambuj as an \u201caugmented analytics\u201d company with the goal of improving business operations through analysis and automation. They\u2019d all three worked together on the OneDrive team at Microsoft and went on to spend time at Dropbox, Amazon, Amperity, Code.org and Zulily. Akmal was the VP of product and engineering at Code.org and the head of product at Amperity, while Kambuj previously headed engineering at Dropbox\u2019s search team. Zana, meanwhile, was a senior software developer at Amazon working on the Fire TV line of devices.\n\n\u201cOur thesis was that while companies collect mountains of data, the return on investment on it remains low because it\u2019s predominantly used in dashboards and reporting, not daily actions and automation,\u201d Akmal told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThe modern data stack has seen billions of dollars of investment but requires a massive and expensive workforce of data engineers, scientists and analysts to mine data for insights. These people are in high demand and there aren\u2019t enough to go around. So for the 90% of companies that can\u2019t hire and retain such talent at scale, there must be solutions like Falkon to get the same value from data that we\u2019ve all been promised.\u201d\n\nFalkon\u2019s platform tries to unify a company\u2019s go-to-market data (e.g. product usage metrics, customer relationship management and sales enablement data and web traffic), de-duplicating the info and generating \u201cdata-driven\u201d recommendations for sales and marketing teams \u2014 specifically sales development representatives, account executives and account managers. Falkon can uncover \u201cstuck\u201d sales pipelines and find new opportunities, according to Akmal, through algorithms and a collection of apps that can be used together or individually.\n\nFalkon users can connect business intelligence tools to the platform to do reporting on customer accounts, contacts and channels data. Insights are delivered via Slack, email and embedded apps in services from Salesforce and other vendors; Falkon can automate workflows like enrollment in marketing campaigns and Salesforce task creation.\n\n\u201cGo-to-market intelligence is a fractured space with many point solutions. We take a horizontal and comprehensive approach,\u201d Akmal said. \u201cWe use econometric techniques, [relying] on one fundamental approach: Success prevalence. Tactics that are often prevalent in successful outcomes (like deals being won, standout reps and features used by customers that convert) and less often present in failure outcomes (like deals being lost and underperforming reps) are the winning tactics and companies should bet on them more than losing tactics, which are detected through the same approach.\u201d\n\nAkmal wouldn\u2019t reveal revenue figures but claimed that Seattle-based Falkon is seeing brisk uptake, with a customer base that includes Redis Labs, Icertis and Zendesk.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
