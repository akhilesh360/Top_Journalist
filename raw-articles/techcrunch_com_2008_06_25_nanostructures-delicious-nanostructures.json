At the scale they\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s essentially like laying down nano-wire in any pattern they want to create. It\u2019s a bit like filling a mold with play-dough and then scraping off the extra.\n\nWe don\u2019t always report hard science stuff like this, but this is interesting because I think it will have effects on some of the devices we use. After all, transistor technology is nudging the nanotech barrier (at 45nm now it\u2019s just a few more shrinkages before classical physics give way to quantum physics) and devices like PCBs are being forced ever smaller. I don\u2019t pretend to understand this new method, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really even applicable, but it\u2019s channels of conductive metal being made on an incredibly tiny scale, which makes it my business.
