But on top of that, Sesamm also offers a web-based dashboard where companies can access data analysis, visualizations, and push notifications for various due diligence, compliance and ESG scenarios.\n\nFor example, a company that wants to keep tabs on its supply chain partners can use Sesamm to track anything related to those partners that hits the public domain, such as emerging fraud litigation or other lawsuits. This allows them to proactively respond the instant they receive an alert via Sesamm \u2014 these ESG alerts, which Sesamm launched a few months back, can be delivered by email or system integrations, for example a customer relationship management (CRM) application.\n\nElsewhere, private equity firms can use Sesamm for due diligence on potential acquisition or investment targets. Indeed, Sesamm boasts a \u201c20 billion article data lake\u201d to which it applies its NLP algorithms to identify mentions on any type of company, with the data sliced, diced and categorized into user-friendly dashboards.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cPrivate equity firms usually engage with consulting firms to perform due diligence on target companies,\u201d Sesamm co-founder and CEO Sylvain Fort\u00e9 explained to TechCrunch. \u201cThe cost of doing this is very high, and the result is suboptimal as the amount of data on the web is enormous for individuals to go through it. Therefore frequently, the results are not comprehensive enough, leading to inaccuracies.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Sesamm platform can be configured for any number of use cases, such as \u201cshare of voice\u201d competitor analysis, or any other theme that might be relevant to a company.\n\n\u201cWith the current attention on ESG in the industry, many of our use-cases are focused on that \u2014 however, we provide insights into several types of information,\u201d Fort\u00e9 said. \u201cThis includes sentiment on brands, thematic stock baskets and indices, company leadership reputation, and web insights on macro-economic indicators such as inflation, among others.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fort\u00e9, Sesamm pre-trains large language models, similar to that of ChatGPT, the generative AI poster child of the moment \u2014 on all the data it hoovers up, and fine-tunes the algorithms on its own datasets, which are annotated across the 100-plus languages it supports.\n\n\u201cSesamm integrates a variety of data \u2014 over 20 billion articles in 100 languages with 14 years of history,\u201d Fort\u00e9 said. \u201cData sources include highly vetted news organizations, expert blogs and social media. Sesamm also manages licenses for proprietary data sources from premium news channels.\u201d\n\nSesamm\u2019s competition includes a swathe of well-funded rivals, including New York-based AlphaSense, which hit a $1.7 billion valuation last year and Dataminr, which most recently was a $4.1 billion company. And FactSet, a $15 billion financial data powerhouse, entered the realm of AI-powered ESG data when it acquired Truvalue Labs three years ago.\n\nHowever, against the backdrop of the ChatGPT hype train and burgeoning corporate ESG commitments, the fact that Sesamm has raised a significant sum of money at a time when investors\u2019 cash has seemingly dried up tells something of a story.\n\n\u201cRaising a significant amount during challenging market conditions highlights the relevancy of Sesamm\u2019s focus on two key trends \u2014 AI and sustainability,\u201d Fort\u00e9 said. \u201cIn turn, these tools enable organizations to make better decisions and fill the data gaps, particularly in ESG, on both public and private companies.\u201d\n\nPrior to now, Sesamm had raised around \u20ac15 million ($16 million), and with its latest cash injection \u2014 which it\u2019s calling a Series B2 round \u2014 the startup ushers in a slew of new and existing investors, some of which are also customers. These include BNP Paribas\u2019 VC arm Opera Tech Ventures, which co-led the round alongside VC firm Elaia; Carlyle Group; Unigestion; Raiffeisen Bank International\u2019s VC off-shoot Elevator Ventures; AFG Partners, CEGEE Capital; and New Alpha Asset Management.\n\nSesamm said that it\u2019s planning to use its fresh capital to expand further into the U.S. and Asian markets."}
