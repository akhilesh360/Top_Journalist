Currently available in public preview, they work with GitHub and Azure DevOps to start, with additional product integrations to come down the line.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCrunch, Microsoft CVP of cloud security Shawn Bice said that Defender for DevOps and Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (or Defender CSPM, to refer to it by its more wieldy acronym) arose from the challenges companies are increasingly facing as they use cloud-native services to deploy and manage applications. These customers often have incomplete visibility and a lack of prioritized mitigations, he said, making their security reactive as opposed to proactive.\n\nThere\u2019s truth to that. According to a 2020 report from Orca Security, 59% of cybersecurity teams report receiving more than 500 alerts about cloud security per day \u2014 a large portion of which are false positives. Tool sprawl is often cited as a challenge in maintaining code security. Responding to a GitLab survey from August, 41% of DevOps teams said that they used between six to 10 tools in their development toolchains, leading them to miss security issues.\n\n\u201cThe accelerated cloud transformation journey for our customers has created an urgent need for a unified solution to manage security from development to runtime in multicloud and multiple pipeline environments,\u201d Bice said via email.\n\nTo this end, Defender CSPM leverages AI algorithms to perform contextual risk analyses of software dev environments. Resulting recommendations and insights are piped into source code management platforms like GitHub and Azure DevOps to drive remediation efforts; alternatively, users can create workflows connected to security recommendations to trigger automated remediation.\n\nDefender CSPM also provides \u201cattack queries\u201d that security teams can use to explore risk and threat data, as well as a dashboard showing all the rules implemented across dev environments and tools that allow security admins to define new rules.\n\nAs for Defender for DevOps, it shows the security posture of pre-production app code and resource configurations. Security teams can use the service to enable templates and container images designed to minimize the chance that cloud misconfigurations reach production environments.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Grand View Research estimates that the market for DevSecOps \u2014 which spans tools that automate security practices at every step of software development \u2014 was worth $2.79 billion in 2020.\n\nStartups including Spectral, which aims to detect potential security issues in codebases and logs, and Cycode, which offers tools to secure DevOps pipelines, might be perceived as competitors. But Microsoft\u2019s scale \u2014 and the fact that both Defender CSPM and Defender for Cloud are free for Defender for Cloud customers during the preview period \u2014 give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is committed to enabling security for all,\u201d Bice added, \u201c[with] a comprehensive cloud security benchmark across multiple clouds.\u201d"}
