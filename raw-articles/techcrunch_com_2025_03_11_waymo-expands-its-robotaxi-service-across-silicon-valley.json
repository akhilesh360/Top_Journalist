(Waymo employees have been taking autonomous trips in that city since January.) Waymo is launching in Miami, too, in partnership with African mobility startup Moove.\n\nWaymo also plans to test in as many as 10 new U.S. cities this year, including Las Vegas and San Diego \u2014 something it\u2019s able to do thanks to a massive $5.6 billion funding round that closed late last year, valuing the robotaxi company at $45 billion.\n\nWith Cruise\u2019s commercial business now dead, Waymo is racing ahead as the leading U.S. robotaxi company.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to trial a version of its long-promised robotaxi service in Austin in June, and possibly in California and other locations by the end of this year. Uber and Yandex spinoff Avride also plan to launch a service in Dallas this year. Amazon-owned Zoox is also working to spin up a commercial launch in Las Vegas and, eventually, in San Francisco as well."}
