It operates on a point system, enabling users to spend points across different models, with each bot having its own point cost per message.\n\nUnder the new $5/month plan, users can spend up to 10,000 points per day. In contrast, the $250/month tier offers 12.5 million points, which the company says is better for more \u201cexpensive\u201d models, such as GPT-4.5, OpenAI\u2019s o1-pro, and Google DeepMind\u2019s Veo 2.\n\nBy popular demand, we are introducing two new subscription options today, at $5/month and $250/month. These align Poe with two simultaneous trends in AI: normal models are getting cheaper and the most advanced models are getting more expensive.

A free plan is also available, but users can only ask a limited number of questions each day.\n\nPoe is available on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows."}
