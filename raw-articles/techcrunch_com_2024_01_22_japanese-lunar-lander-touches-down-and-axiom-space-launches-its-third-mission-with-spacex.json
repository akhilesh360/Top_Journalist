What a week! For the second week in a row, we have lunar lander news to report on. Plus, a final update on Astrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lander, news on the Artemis program and the first crewed launch of the year.\n\nWant to reach out with a tip?

The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) confirmed that they had received telemetry data from SLIM just after 10:20 AM EST.\n\nWhile the landing was a success, not all went to plan, unfortunately: JAXA later said that the lander\u2019s solar cells are not currently generating electricity, which means that the mission lifetime will be greatly reduced. There\u2019s a small chance that the solar cells could charge as the angle of the sun changes, but that depends on whether the cause is due to a pointing issue or some other anomaly, JAXA officials said in a press conference.\n\nBut even with the issue, the mission achieved a huge portion of its goal, which was to demonstrate a soft lunar landing using optical navigation technology. This new type of technology can help ensure \u201cpinpoint\u201d landings, or landings with an accuracy of around 100 meters, as opposed to many kilometers.\n\nLaunch highlights\n\nWe saw our first crewed mission this year \u2013 but even more notably, it was a completely private mission (as in not a NASA astronaut mission). Axiom Space launched its third mission with launch partner SpaceX on Thursday, with the crew successfully docking with the International Space Station at 5:42 AM EST on Saturday, January 20.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Axiom\u2019s fourth flight, Ax-4, is scheduled for later this year, though a specific launch window has not been announced.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nLoren Grush very nicely lays out some of NASA\u2019s forward-thinking strategy with its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program: accept some risk. The program was established to help kickstart the development of payload delivery surfaces to the moon\u2019s surface, and it stands in sharp contrast to NASA\u2019s standard quo.\n\nAstrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lander, which suffered a fatal propulsion leak that prevented the spacecraft from having any chance of landing on the moon, is the result of a CLPS award. While Astrobotic did not complete the mission, Grush describes how NASA designed the program to be more risk-tolerant than its other endeavors.\n\nThis week in space history\n\nThirty-two years ago this week, microgravity research was born. In 1992, NASA launched the first International Microgravity Laboratory on board the space shuttle Discovery, and it carried a number of scientific research and experiments looking into the effects of zero G on materials and living organisms. The lab was pressurized, so the mission also carried a crew of seven; they returned to Earth after eight days in space."}
