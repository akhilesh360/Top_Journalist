No industry outside of defense is as heavily scrutinized, and for good reason: When you deal with people additional caution is essential.\n\nRules, requirements and regulatory complexity may be barriers to entry in the world of digital health startups, but they also present opportunities.\n\nFounders often find creative ways to reconcile the additional oversight, like saying that their launch is merely a proof of concept, or that they can\u2019t justify the cost of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a month on advertising to attract new users.\n\nWhen venture funding was scarce, there was a compelling need to prioritize speed and maximize the runway provided by smaller seed rounds. The environment, however, has changed \u2014 burgeoning investor interest and ample available capital have meant that there\u2019s an even greater need to allocate significant budget to compliance.\n\nSpeed and efficiency may be essential for startups, but regulatory compliance need not be a bottleneck or a financial drain.\n\nIf compliance isn\u2019t a consideration from the start, founders will sooner or later end up in a situation where they have to scramble to fix things behind the scenes, spending huge amounts of money on legal fees \u2014 and that\u2019s the best case scenario. In the worst case, a deal can blow up.\n\nIt is understandable how these concerns can be overlooked at the beginning. There\u2019s a certain amount of creativity and dissatisfaction with the status quo necessary for founders to conceive of building something that doesn\u2019t already exist.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The stakes are higher than creating the next puzzle game or food delivery app.\n\n\u201cMove fast and break things\u201d is a strategy glorified in startup culture. But entrepreneurs in the healthcare industry have a responsibility \u2014 both ethical and legal \u2014 to the patients who will use their products and services.\n\nWhat should you prioritize?\n\nFirst, companies should involve legal. They must insist the lawyers measure twice and cut once so that the architecture of the business model is built to scale.\n\nTerms of use and privacy policies may seem like boilerplate, but given that for every telemedicine company they form the core contract with customers, there\u2019s a surprising amount of customization required.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean developing something more specific has to blow up your budget. It does mean that rather than copying and pasting, you should take the time to ensure the main compact between the patient and company actually reflects every business practice the company plans to pursue.\n\nSmall precautions, like properly worded customer policies and releases, can help prevent surprises from federal agencies like the Federal Trade Commission or Health and Human Services. Regulatory intervention can mean hefty fines, lingering embarrassment and lasting damage to your public image. For just one of many recent examples, look at the outrage that ensued after Flo, an app that tracks menstrual cycles, sold users\u2019 data without consent.\n\nUndisclosed settlements with regulators are actually not what companies should focus on. No matter how well your company follows the law, eventually someone who knows what they\u2019re doing will get a look under the hood. In fact, it\u2019s entirely possible for a digital health startup to go through its entire life without government intervention \u2014 even if it\u2019s not compliant.\n\nHarder to avoid, however, is scrutiny from investors. Investors know what to look for, and with so much money involved these days, due diligence is impossible to dodge.\n\nBy thinking ahead and avoiding shortcuts, founders can create a sustainable model for investors and patients alike."}
