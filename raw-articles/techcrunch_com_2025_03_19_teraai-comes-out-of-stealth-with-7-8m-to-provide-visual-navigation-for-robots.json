Further, robotics often involves expensive, ready-made hardware solutions that include built-in software and sensors designed for specific tasks, like estimating relative motion. These products require complex integration and are limited to specific use cases.\n\nAs a result, most robots today cannot move between different locations, and only a small percentage of self-driving systems use AI for navigation.\n\nBut Tera AI founder and CEO Tony Zhang thinks software known as zero-shot navigation for robots can overcome these obstacles \u2014 and investors just gave him $7.8 million in seed funding to prove it.\n\nAt a high level, Tera AI is building a spatial reasoning AI system to provide affordable visual navigation for autonomous robots. This technology is used in various applications, including robotic manipulation, mobile robotics, and automated driving.\n\n\u201cWe take a pure-software, platform-agnostic approach through an over-the-air software update that works with any robot with a pre-existing camera and a GPU,\u201d Zhang said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThe system is cognition-inspired and can be applied during inference time to entirely novel scenarios \u2014 a bit like a large language model (LLM).\u201d\n\nZhang founded San Francisco-based Tera in 2023 after leading machine learning efforts at Google X, where he worked on developing and commercializing geospatial models. He earned his PhD at Caltech under Pietro Perona, a pioneer in computer vision who studied how biological systems solve navigation in a general-purpose way.\n\nThe startup\u2019s team includes AI and simulation researchers from Google AI, Caltech, MIT, and the European Space Agency.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Spatial reasoning AI allows machines to navigate, recognize objects, and interact with three-dimensional space. General-purpose navigation software that eliminates hardware constraints could further drastically lower costs and implementation time, making robots 1,000 times more valuable, Zhang told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cIt could also enable new capabilities for existing robots in areas where autonomy was simply impossible due to constraints on sensors,\u201d he said.\n\nFor example, a Waymo vehicle costing $250,000 can afford a $50,000 localization sensor and $100,000 lidar system. But lighter robots priced under $50,000 need more affordable solutions to navigate autonomously, according to Tera AI. Additionally, a high-precision GPS receiver can cost $10,000, and a top-tier IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) can reach $30,000 \u2014 expenses that put autonomous navigation out of reach for many smaller robots.\n\n\u201cOur key unique value proposition is that we are completely hardware agnostic, which means we focus on solving general-purpose navigation in pure software form for any robot and any new environment without needing to be re-tuned every single time,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cFor the first time in robotics, we can sell a piece of software that acts like an operating system, giving any mobile robotic platform the ability to live up to its full potential and deliver on its promises to its customers.\u201d\n\nThe startup has been testing its product with various key U.S.-based players in the robotics industry. The company\u2019s clients are primarily robotic manufacturers that already have customers but face challenges when expanding their solutions to different autonomy platforms, situations, and environments.\n\nThe new funding will help Tera deploy its initial solution on embedded devices this year and expand its technical team.\n\n\u201cWe see a future where software becomes the most valuable asset of robotic platforms. Once people realize that existing cameras that are already on robots are sufficient for positioning and navigation, they will be able to deploy cheaper robots more quickly at scale,\u201d Zhang told TechCrunch. \u201cEventually, we envision a future where, like an iOS app store, you can install new capabilities simply by clicking download and boom \u2014 your robot has a brand new ability.\u201d\n\nInvestors in Tera\u2019s seed round include Felicis, Inovia, Caltech, Wilson Hill, and entrepreneur-investor Naval Ravikant."}
