Among the startups joining the trend, the current forecast looks good for one startup, Little Umbrella, which leverages AI for its social party games.\n\nThe company announced on Thursday its $2 million seed funding round. Little Umbrella plans to use the new capital to help expedite the launch of three AI-powered social games, set to be released in the coming year.\n\nSocial games are experiencing a resurgence, particularly within online communities like Discord. This genre is appealing to players and their friends because they are quick to play and primarily depend on group dynamics for enjoyment. Jackbox Games is a notable example; its core focus is on party video games that attract millions of players. In 2021 alone, players reportedly participated in over 72.2 million games.\n\nLittle Umbrella believes it can differentiate itself by using AI to develop games more rapidly than ever before. Additionally, because large language models (LLMs) can be unpredictable, employing them as game masters ensures that each round will be different and entertaining.\n\nThe startup\u2019s flagship title, Death by AI, quickly became a hit after its launch last year. Within the first three months, the game attracted over 20 million players. Its success is not surprising, as it features a hilarious premise: Players are challenged to create deadly scenarios and observe how they and their friends would react. Utilizing generative AI, the game evaluates whether a player succeeds or fails, allowing each player five attempts before they are eliminated.\n\nDeath by AI is available for free on Discord, the web, and iOS. It can be played by up to eight players.\n\nImage Credits:Little Umbrella\n\nLittle Umbrella will soon launch its new party game, tentatively titled The Last Show by AI. The company describes it as a dystopian game show hosted by sinister AI game masters. In the game, players must survive while voting their friends out in the process. The company plans to launch a beta version during the 2025 Game Developers Conference in March.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This technology enables developers to create ambitious games with minimal effort, reducing costs in the process. For instance, Little Umbrella claims that it was able to develop and launch Death by AI in just 10 weeks. In contrast, Jackbox Games releases its game packs on a nearly annual schedule.\n\nLittle Umbrella developed a cross-platform social game kit called Playroom to power Death by AI, along with its upcoming projects. This kit includes an AI orchestration layer that utilizes multiple custom models in partnership with ElevenLabs, Inworld, and OpenAI.\n\nPlayroom is currently available to all video game developers and costs between $10 and $150 per month, depending on the size of the team. There\u2019s also a free version.\n\nImage Credits:Little Umbrella\n\nThe small gaming studio is led by Tabish Ahmed, who was formerly the design leader at Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds. Recognizing the opportunity to create social experiences on platforms like Discord, where friends already interact, Ahmed noted that cross-platform development poses significant challenges for studios, leading to a gap between demand and content availability.\n\n\u201cAt Little Umbrella, we\u2019ve embraced this challenge by creating platform-agnostic social games that are built and maintained at a fraction of the cost using AI, designed specifically for where players gather with their friends, bridging the gaps in both demand and scalability,\u201d Ahmed told TechCrunch.\n\nThe team also includes Timothy Johnson (CTO), who previously worked at Gallium Studios building AI-simulated worlds, and Sean Webster (CBO), former AppLovin vice president and head of partnerships at Snap. Additionally, Little Umbrella\u2019s art director, Bill Robison, has contributed his skills to popular titles like \u201cBoss Baby,\u201d \u201cScoob!,\u201d and \u201cYoung Jedi Adventures.\u201d\n\nInvestors who participated in the latest round include a16z speedrun, Breakpoint Ventures, Disrupt.com, GFR Fund, ubiQuoss Investment, Venture Reality Fund, and Workplay Ventures (Mark Pincus\u2019 VC firm), along with angel investors Matt Bilbey (former Electronic Arts exec) and Flexport founder Ryan Peterson."}
