After a dramatic pause, he continued: \u201cAnd speaking of the sky, we\u2019re exploring rockets, too. Because the future of mobility shouldn\u2019t be limited to just Earth, or just one car company\u201d \u2014 a possible dig at Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk is also the founder and CEO of SpaceX.\n\nToyoda initially didn\u2019t offer any details except for showing a rendering onstage of a rocket designed by Interstellar Technologies, a private Japanese spaceflight company that\u2019s working on a small launch vehicle made to put satellites into space. After the conference, Toyoda and other executives elaborated on the idea, telling TechCrunch the company is working with Interstellar Technologies to explore what kind of telecommunications network should be established to support the needs of Woven City, a prototype city located on 175 acres at the foot of Mount Fuji designed to be a living laboratory. Toyota first announced plans to build the city in 2020 and announced Monday the first phase is now open.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about cars that will be constantly moving, you need to have appropriate telecommunications,\u201d Hajime Kumabe, the CEO of Woven by Toyota, told TechCrunch during a media briefing. \u201cThis means that the communication should not be interrupted, disrupted, and that seamless communication that is achieved.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Woven City\u2019s location is mountainous, making it appropriate to explore what would be the appropriate communication network infrastructure to support autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe executives also confirmed that Woven by Toyota has invested 7 billion yen, or about $44.3 million, into Interstellar Technologies.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Sony surprise-announced it was working on an electric car five years ago at CES and barely gave the news more than a few minutes of stage time.\n\nToyota, meanwhile, has been lambasted for years for its overly cautious stance on developing electric vehicles. That now looks like a prescient move as big automakers scale back their ambitious plans for electrification. And maybe Toyota simply had its eyes on a much different prize \u2014 space."}
