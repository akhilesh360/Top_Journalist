There is also a self-defense course.\n\nEven in a post-pandemic world, the platform is attracting interest owing to a confluence of trends. Kids are becoming increasingly disengaged from P.E. classes in schools, often choosing to skip them entirely. Many students dread P.E. for its highly competitive environment, where bullying occurs often.\n\nAdditionally, parents across the U.S. are struggling to pay youth sports expenses. Titus and Suhr, who bonded over second-grade baseball, want their kids to experience the same enjoyment in sports that they once did, but many of these same experiences are becoming unattainable.\n\n\u201cAs a parent in New York City,\u201d said Titus, \u201cthe inequities of the cost of sports was beyond me. I was my son\u2019s first soccer coach, and the cost of it was just so high. I [wondered], \u2018How does a family that lives in low-income housing afford soccer?\u2019\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Hiveclass\n\nInvestors also recognize the value of online P.E. courses. Hiveclass \u2014 where Titus is CEO and Suhr is chief product officer \u2014 just raised $1.5 million seed funding.\n\nThe funding will be allocated to product development. It will also be used to enhance a teacher portal that\u2019s used by educators who use Hiveclass to increase engagement in their classrooms.

In addition to the videos, there are quizzes in between clips that require written responses, helping to keep kids focused and engaged.\n\nAccessing that teacher portal on the platform, educators can view all their students and their quiz answers to ensure that everyone is completing their work. (Hiveclass says another selling point is that students can earn P.E credits outside of class.)\n\nHiveclass believes it stands out from other edtech platforms and even educational YouTube channels by emphasizing the P.E. and wellness field. The company claims to align with national standards set forth by SHAPE America, the Society of Health and Physical Educators organization that governs physical education in the U.S. Its closest rival, PLT4M, is also a SHAPE America member.\n\nThe company currently partners with more than 80 educational institutions and has over 13,000 students and teachers on the platform.\n\nHiveclass doesn\u2019t publicly disclose pricing; it says that it\u2019s tailored for each client based on their specific requirements, including student count. But it says it has generated more than $2 million in revenue and hopes to hit an additional $1 million by next month. The outfit is also exploring additional revenue streams, says Titus, including licensing agreements.\n\nThe recent round was led by Spring Mountain Capital. Other investors in the round included Georgetown Angel Investor Network (GAIN), New York State Venture Fund, Rethink Education, and Techstars.\n\nThe funding brings the startup\u2019s total capital raised to over $3 million."}
