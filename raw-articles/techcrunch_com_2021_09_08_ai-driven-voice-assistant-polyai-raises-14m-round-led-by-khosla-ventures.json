This follows their $12 million Series A, and will provide resources for further U.S. expansion beyond its existing U.S. team. The startup has now raised $28 million to date.\n\nPolyAI builds and deploys voice assistants for automating customer services, which, claims the startup, sound like real humans. This helps companies get an infinite and cheaper supply of their best human voice operators, which reduces customer waiting times, and increases customer satisfaction and retention, says the company.\n\nCo-founder Dr Nikola Mrk\u0161i\u0107 said: \u201cThe technical term for our technology is \u2018multi-turn conversational AI\u2019, but all the caller has to do is talk to it, like they would to a human. Compared to existing call centers, our assistants can boost customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores by up to 40% and reduce handling times by up to five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe build these systems very quickly (relative to the competition) \u2014 we get experiences like these up and running in 2-4 weeks thanks to our transformer-based language understanding models and the underlying dialog management platform,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a statement, Vinod Khosla said: \u201cPolyAI is one of the first AI companies using the newest generation of large pre-trained deep learning models (akin to BERT and GPT-3) in a real-world enterprise product. This means they can deploy automated AI agents in as little as two weeks, where incumbent providers of voice assistants would take up to six months to deploy an older version of this technology.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nA spinout from the University of Cambridge, PolyAI says it is effectively \u201cpushing at an open door\u201d as the pandemic has led to staffing shortages in call centers, driving more companies to deploy smart voice assistants, which appear not to have been replaced chatbots at all, as consumers generally prefer to speak than type.\n\n\u201cWe were expecting the system to handle 40% of calls, but at launch it handled 80%, and within two weeks it was up to 87%,\u201d said Brian Jeppesen of Landry\u2019s Golden Nugget Hotels & Casinos. \u201cCallers think the AI agent is human\u201d, Jeppesen continued, \u201cwhich is great because the voice assistant never has a bad day, and is on 24/7. I wish I could hire more agents like that!\u201d\n\nCompetitors include Nuance (recently acquired by Microsoft), Isoft, Interactions, SmartAction and Replicant. But PolyAI says its voice assistant can be turned live more quickly, in more languages, and charges on a per-minute basis.\n\nFounded by Nikola Mrk\u0161i\u0107 (CEO), Tsung-Hsien Wen (CTO) and Pei-Hao Su (Engineering Director), the three met while doing PhDs with Professor Steve Young, a leader in spoken dialog systems who pioneered many technologies that underpin voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa.\n\nRecent PolyAI clients include Landry\u2019s Entertainment, Greene King, Starling Bank and Viasat."}
