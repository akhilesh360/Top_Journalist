Today lawmakers are reupping the regulation that lets EU citizens \u201croam like at home\u201d for a full decade, meaning European consumers can keep avoiding most extra fees when travelling within another of the 27 EU Member States (or the EEA) until at least 2032.\n\nThe updated regulation also brings some new additions \u2014 including a focus on quality of service, with a requirement that consumers have access to the same services abroad in the EU as at home when the same networks and technologies are available on the network in the visited Member State.\n\nThis means, for example, that a roaming customer who can use 5G services at home should also have 5G roaming services \u2014 where they are available \u2014 in the visited Member State.\n\nThe quality of service provision does not mean a guarantee of getting the same mobile network speed when roaming, since network speeds can vary, but the Commission says the new rules \u201caim to ensure that when similar quality or speeds are available in the visited network, the domestic operator should ensure the same quality of the roaming service.\u201d\n\nOperators are also required to inform their customers of the quality of services they can expect while roaming by stating this in the roaming contract and publishing information on their website.\n\nThe Commission argues that quality of service will be increasingly important as 5G rollouts expand and mobile network technology continues to evolve (its PR includes the phrase \u201cfuture 6G\u201d \u2014 alongside talk of the EU \u201cinvesting in developing and using innovative digital solutions\u201d).\n\n\u201cAs concerns 5G services, it will become more and more important for consumers travelling abroad to know if they could be affected by limitations in available network quality when using certain applications and services,\u201d it suggests. \u201cThe new roaming rules aim to enable innovation and business development, ensuring the widest use of innovative services and minimising the risk that citizens would not be able to use certain applications requiring the latest network technology, such as 5G, when crossing internal EU borders.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Well this is history. And we intend to keep it this way for at least the next 10 years. Better speed, more transparency: We keep improving EU citizens\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nTransparency\n\nAnother focus for the EU\u2019s updated regulation is around increasing transparency about the types of services that can still bring additional costs when roaming, such as calling customer service numbers, help desks or insurance companies \u2014 to help travellers in the bloc avoid related \u2018bill shocks.\u2019\n\nThe Commission says consumers who are roaming should receive an SMS about \u201cpotential increased charges\u201d from using such services.\n\n\u201cThe SMS should include a link to a dedicated webpage providing additional information on the types of services and, if available, about the relevant phone numbering ranges,\u201d it notes, suggesting operators may also include information about the types of services that may be subject to higher charges in roaming in their contracts with the consumers.\n\nThe updated rules are also intended to improve information provisions about and access to emergency communications across the EU \u2014 such as via the single European emergency number, 112.\n\n\u201cDialing the emergency numbers and transmitting information on the location of the caller while roaming should be seamless and for free. Likewise, citizens who cannot place a call to 112 should be able to access emergency services free of charge through alternative means when roaming, for example through real-time text or a smartphone application,\u201d says the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe new roaming rules also reinforce access to emergency services, through calls and alternative means of communications in case of cross-border use. It will also ensure that the transmission of caller location will be seamless and free of charge while using roaming services.\u201d\n\nThe EU is continuing to regulate wholesale caps \u2014 controlling the maximum prices a visited operator may charge for the use of its network by another operator in order to provide roaming services \u2014 with the Commission describing this as \u201can essential element for the sustainability of \u2018roam like at home\u2019 for operators.\u201d Its review of the roaming market concluded that wholesale caps should be further reduced.\n\n\u201cThe co-legislators agreed on a gradual reduction of the wholesale caps from 2022 onwards,\u201d it notes. \u201cThese caps reflect decreasing operators\u2019 wholesale costs of providing roaming services, provide sufficient investment incentives and maximise sustainability for EU operators.\u201d\n\nThe Commission expects these wholesale cost reductions to lead to benefits for consumers \u2014 such as more generous data allowances while roaming and less likelihood of consumers having to pay surcharges for data usage that exceed contract allowances.\n\nOperators will still be able to apply a \u2018fair use\u2019 policy \u2014 meaning that if a person moves to live in another EU country it will be better for them to move to a local contract, as permanent roaming is no longer considered \u2018fair use.\u2019"}
