The company is not disclosing its valuation, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that this latest injection is being described as an extension to that $43 million Series B rather than a new round. We\u2019ll update this if we learn more. The total raised by the company is now $113 million.\n\nThe capital and relocation speaks not just to a key moment for the company, but also for the area of machine learning and wider trends impacting Chinese-founded startups.\n\nOn the first of these, Zilliz\u2019s breakout product, the open source Milvus, has boomed. The company said that downloads have now passed the 1 million mark, compared to 300,000 a year ago, with production users growing by 300% in the same period \u2014 however, it didn\u2019t disclose its active user numbers. Customers include the likes of eBay, Tencent, Walmart, Ikea, Intuit and Compass.\n\nAs we pointed out back in 2020, Milvus has not leaned heavily on advertising and marketing spend, instead choosing to leverage word of mouth on the places where developers like to hang out for ideas and inspiration to get itself noticed, such as GitHub and Reddit. That strategy has worked: \u201cStargazers\u201d on GitHub are up 200% to more than 11,000 with the number of contributors doubling. (For a point of comparison, in 2020 it had been starred some 4,400 times.)\n\nThe reason for the interest in Milvus \u2014 and subsequently Zilliz\u2019s roadmap, which is based around creating further products, most recently a Zilliz Cloud-managed service that is now in private preview; and Towhee, another open source framework, this one for for vector data ETL \u2014 is because of the rising interest in vector databases as how they are being used in AI applications.\n\nPut simply, while data can be (and often is) processed via more traditional databases, the complexity of and structure of activities like anomaly detection, recommendation, rating and other AI-driven tasks lends itself more naturally and efficiently to vector databases designed to work with how AI data is represented. (Zilliz notes that its vector database \u201cis both cloud native and capable of processing billion-scale vector data in milliseconds.\u201d)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

We will continue to serve as a primary contributor and committer to Milvus and deliver on our promise to provide a fully managed vector database service on public cloud with the security, reliability, ease of use, and affordability that enterprises require.\u201d\n\nThere are others (competitors to Zilliz) like Pinecone and Weaviate also building solutions to address this. Pinecone raised money earlier this year and has some impressive names backing it, including Tiger Global and Menlo Ventures (for a point of comparison, PitchBook says Pinecone\u2019s valuation is $168 million). Weaviate\u2019s parent, SeMI Technologies out of The Netherlands, also raised this year, backed by the likes of NEA.\n\nMeanwhile, big cloud providers like AWS also have their own solutions. All of that points to a market opportunity that Zilliz is focused to tackle.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that back in 2020, Zilliz already said that more than half of the users of Milvus were outside of China: That speaks to how the company has long positioned itself and where it saw its growth longer-term. Xie \u2014 who goes by the nickname \u201cStarlord\u201d (yes) and previously worked as a software engineer at Oracle in the U.S. before relocating to start Zilliz in Shanghai \u2014 told TC that he thought of the startup as \u201cglobal from day one.\u201d But he saw an opportunity to build first in Shanghai because of the affordability of hiring engineers as well as the market size of China, and thus the volume of unstructured data to hand.\n\n\u201cThe amount of unstructured data in a region is in proportion to the size of its population and the level of its economic activity, so it\u2019s easy to see why China is the biggest data source,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nOf course, these days, as a number of startups in the country are looking to move elsewhere to have more freedom in terms of how they grow their businesses, and to work with a wider set of customers, Zilliz is an example of that in action.\n\nProsperity7 has been playing a role in facilitating this migration. The fund only entered China last year and has been actively hunting down startups with a global ambition, which could tap the firm\u2019s vast global network. We recently covered two such investments, Jaka, a Beijing- and Shanghai-based collaborative robotics startup, and Insilico, an AI drug platform from Hong Kong.\n\nProsperity7\u2019s investment in Zilliz seems to fit nicely into the investor\u2019s mandate. It\u2019s not uncommon to see Chinese SaaS companies going global these days. Many are started by Chinese entrepreneurs with an international background. They might have spent a few years testing the market at home and raising from VCs who are increasingly keen on B2B projects as the B2C space becomes saturated. But many find it hard to monetize in China, where small and medium enterprise owners are still reluctant to pay for software subscriptions compared to their Western corporate counterparts.\n\n\u201cWith its leadership on Milvus, Zilliz is a global leader in vector similarity search on massive amounts of unstructured data,\u201d said Aysar Tayeb, executive MD of Prosperity7 Ventures, in a statement. \u201cWe believe that the company is in a strong position to build a cloud platform around Milvus that will unleash new and powerful business insights and outcomes for its customers, just as data analytics platforms like Databricks and Snowflake have done with structured data. There is already over 4x more unstructured data than structured data, a gap that will continue to grow as AI, robotics, IoT, and other technologies meld the digital and physical realms.\u201d"}
