Now, we have one of the latest examples of how that is playing out in terms of venture funding. Qventus, a startup that builds AI-based tools to automate work across a range of healthcare scenarios \u2014 they include surgeries, hospital discharges, and inpatient/outpatient check-ups \u2014 has raised a Series D of $105 million.\n\nThe funding, which includes $85 million in equity and $20 million in optional debt, will be used to develop more \u201cAI teammates\u201d to use across a wider set of use cases beyond the in-patient applications that helped Qventus make its name, the company said.\n\n\u201cDebt is available as we go forward if we want to put the pedal to the metal,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Mudit Garg in an interview. \u201cTo be candid, we needed neither equity nor debt but it was an opportunity.\u201d\n\nKKR is leading the round, with previous backer Bessemer Venture Partners also participating. The round also has a number of prominent strategic investors who are also customers of Qventus: Northwestern Medicine, HonorHealth, and Allina Health. The company\u2019s valuation is not being disclosed, but we understand from sources that it is more than $400 million.\n\nSignificantly, the fundraise underscores the interest that AI healthcare is attracting at the moment among investors. In the last few days, Cera in the U.K. raised $150 million in financing, Hippocratic got $141 million, and Innovaccer has roped in $275 million.\n\nIt also points to Qventus\u2019 own progress. This latest Series D is bigger than all of the startup\u2019s previous rounds put together \u2014 PitchBook notes that Qventus had raised around $95 million before this round. Its last valuation, in 2022, was around $200 million.\n\nGarg said that Qventus has grown its customer base four-fold since then, working out to net retention of 120%, and its core business has seen three-fold growth. It is not revealing revenue or any other specific numbers, but Garg noted that the company is \u201cvery close to breaking even.\u201d That detail has become more important in recent years as startups look for more sustainable business models given that the IPO window remains relatively small while investors look for returns.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Qventus itself has been around for more than 12 years, getting its start initially by applying machine learning and other kinds of automation technologies to make clinicians and other medical professionals more efficient. It later expanded into more areas of development such as pharmacy operations.\n\nMore recently, the developments in generative AI have pushed the company closer to building solutions that are more responsive to what clinicians are working on in real time.\n\n\u201cIf you think of where care teams are doing in \u2018below license tasks,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to admin work that is part and parcel of clinical work these days, \u201cmachine learning has already been in this space for 12 years.\u201d Generative AI, he said, has helped bring more unstructured data into the mix to improve how AI tools can be used to help clinicians carry out more of that admin work, \u201cemailing and faxing far beyond [what an AI scribe can do] to take the burden off the user.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re likely to see more activity in the AI healthcare space in the coming year, both in terms of fundraises for promising companies, as well as M&A to consolidate the field.\n\n\u201cQventus is at the intersection of themes that KKR has spent extensive time evaluating across both our Technology and Health Care teams,\u201d Jake Heller, a partner and head tech growth, Americas, at KKR, told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cThe company is at a key growth moment, especially during this time where health systems are adopting technology more and more to drive efficiency. The company\u2019s technology meaningfully alleviates care orchestration and administrative burdens for physicians and medical staff, which allows providers to focus on delivering the best care to patients.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!
