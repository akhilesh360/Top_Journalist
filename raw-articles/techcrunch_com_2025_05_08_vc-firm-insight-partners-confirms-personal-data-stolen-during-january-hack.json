The company previously attributed the hack to a \u201csophisticated\u201d social engineering attack, but has not yet provided evidence for this claim. The specific nature of the attack remains unclear.\n\nA spokesperson for Insight Partners did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe VC firm has more than $90 billion in regulated assets under management, making it one of the largest tech startup investors in the world. Insight has helped to fund cybersecurity giants, including Wiz and Armis.\n\nInsight Partners is the latest venture capital firm in recent years to experience a cyberattack. In 2021, Silicon Valley venture firm Advanced Technology Ventures was hit by a ransomware attack that allowed criminals to steal data on the firm\u2019s limited partners."}
