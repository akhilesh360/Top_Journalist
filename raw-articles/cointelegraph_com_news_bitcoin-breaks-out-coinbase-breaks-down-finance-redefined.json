For Bitcoin, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs accounted for an estimated 75% of new investment after launching, which helped BTC recapture the $50,000 mark in February 2024, a month after the ETFs debuted for trading.\n\nWhile a Solana ETF may generate only a fraction of the inflows of Bitcoin ETFs, it could increase Solana\u2019s institutional adoption in the long term by offering investors a \u201cregulated investment vehicle\u201d that may still attract billions of dollars in capital, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told Cointelegraph.\n\nContinue reading\n\nStarknet hits \u201cStage 1\u201d decentralization, tops ZK-rollups for value locked\n\nEthereum layer-2 scaling platform Starknet has reached a decentralization milestone laid out by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and is now the largest zero-knowledge rollup-based network by total value locked.\n\nStarknet said in a news release shared with Cointelegraph that it has hit \u201cStage 1\u201d decentralization, according to a framework Buterin laid out in 2022, which means the network operates with limited oversight or \u201ctraining wheels.\u201d\n\nStarknet added that the framework was the \u201cgold standard onchain tool for analyzing Ethereum scaling solutions,\u201d and said it achieved the milestone through changes such as creating a security council and censorship-avoidance mechanisms.\n\nWhile the system still allows intervention from a security council, it has implemented a fully functional validity proof system governed by smart contracts.\n\nStarknet is now the only layer-2 ZK-rollup network to have reached Stage 1 and has grown to be the largest ZK-rollup blockchain with a total value locked of $629 million, just ahead of ZKsync\u2019s $610 million, according to L2beat.\n\nStarknet is the fifth-largest layer-2 network by value locked, with the top four all Optimistic rollup-based, having reached Stage 1 decentralization using fraud proofs.\n\nContinue reading\n\nDeFi market overview\n\nAccording to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, most of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the week in the green.\n\nSolana-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) rose over 43% as the week\u2019s biggest gainer, followed by decentralized exchange Raydium\u2019s (RAY) token, up nearly 19% over the past week.\n\nTotal value locked in DeFi.
