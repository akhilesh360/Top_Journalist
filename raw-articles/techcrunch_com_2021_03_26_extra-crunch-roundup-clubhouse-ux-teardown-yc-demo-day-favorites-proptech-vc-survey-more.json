People are starting to emerge after sheltering in place for a year, but we are a long way from fully restoring our shared spaces.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen to those semi-vacant office towers, some of which are still under construction? There\u2019s been renewed talk of converting some skyscrapers into residential housing, but there are real economic/logistic hurdles to clear before that can be broadly applied. Scores of restaurants have closed in recent months; who will take over those spaces? I spend a lot of time walking around, and it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve noticed a \u201cGrand Opening\u201d sign.\n\nSeeking answers, Managing Editor Eric Eldon interviewed 10 VCs who are active in proptech and found that most were generally \u201coptimistic.\u201d\n\nSeveral expressed genuine uncertainty about the future of offices, but most were bullish about prospects for remote work, the rebirth of physical retail and the emergence of \u201cthird spaces\u201d that will fill the gap between work and home.\n\nIn a companion article on TechCrunch, Eric explores these broader shifts, concluding, \u201cyou can start to see a world emerging that sounds a lot more like the fantasies of a New Urbanist than the world before the pandemic.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s who he interviewed:\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

if you\u2019re curious about which companies stood out from Y Combinator\u2019s W21 Demo Day, read on.\n\nA look at 4 IPO updates and 2 late-stage funding rounds\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on: The venture capital market is redlining its engines while public markets remain sympathetic to growing, unprofitable companies.\n\nLet\u2019s round up IPO news from DigitalOcean, Kaltura, Robinhood and Zymergen, and big rounds for Lattice and goPuff.\n\nDear Sophie: When can I finally come to Silicon Valley?\n\nDear Sophie:\n\nI\u2019m a startup founder looking to expand in the U.S. I was originally looking at opening an office in Silicon Valley to be close to software engineers and investors, but then \u2026 COVID-19 :)\n\nA lot has changed over the last year \u2014 can I still come?\n\n\u2014 Hopeful in Hungary\n\nStaying ahead of the curve on Google\u2019s Core Web Vitals\n\nAside from improved SEO, small business websites optimizing for Google\u2019s new Core Web Vitals will reap the rewards of an improved user experience for their site visitors.\n\nWhile many are looking at the Core Web Vitals as a big hoop to jump through to please the search powers that be, others are seeing \u2014 and seizing \u2014 the opportunities that come along with this change.\n\nSteady\u2019s Adam Roseman and investor Emmalyn Shaw outline what worked (and what was missing) in the Series A deck\n\nWhen it comes to Steady \u2014 the platform that helps hourly workers manage and maximize their income and access deals on things like benefits and financial services \u2014 the strengths of the business are clear.\n\nBut it took time for founder and CEO Adam Roseman to clearly define and communicate each of them in his quest for fundraising.\n\nDiscord\u2019s reported $10B exit; Compass and Intermedia Cloud Communications set IPO price ranges\n\nAlex Wilhelm dug into Discord\u2019s possible $10 billion exit to Microsoft and explored IPO price ranges for real estate tech company Compass and Intermedia Cloud Communications, a unified-communications-as-a-service company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut if we don\u2019t get through it all now, we\u2019ll fall behind and feel silly later.\u201d\n\nWill fading YOLO sentiment impact Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms?\n\nThe consumer trading frenzy could be slowing.\n\nWhat would happen to Robinhood and its cohorts if the apparent cooling in consumer trading demand continues?\n\nHow VC and private equity funds can launch portfolio-acceleration platforms\n\nAlmost every private equity and venture capital investor now advertises that they have a platform to support their portfolio companies, \u201chowever, most of us don\u2019t have the budget of an Andreessen Horowitz to support almost every major need\u201d for each startup they\u2019ve bet on, says Versatile VC founder David Teten.\n\nIf you\u2019re prioritizing a platform buildout for your firm, consider using the framework he\u2019s outlined.\n\nAutomakers, suppliers and startups see growing market for in-vehicle AR/VR applications\n\nDespite all of the pomp and promises about the potential for AR and VR, there isn\u2019t a clear understanding of market demand for bringing the technology to cars, trucks and passenger vans.\n\nEstimates of the global market range from $14 billion by 2027 to as much as $673 billion by 2025, showing just how nascent the market currently is and how much opportunity is present.\n\nAmid pandemic, Middle East adtech startups play essential role in business growth\n\nThe Middle East is a promising region with growing digital advertising solutions despite locals\u2019 attachment to traditional means of advertising.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a shift to the active use of social media and online shopping, meaning the Middle East embodies great potential for adtech startups.\n\nSocial+ payments: Why fintechs need social features\n\nSocial+ products are seeing mass adoption because they marry community with functionality.\n\nThis applies even to fintech companies as taboos around money fall away.\n\nThe lightning-fast Series A that was 3 years in the making\n\nIt took Christine Tao, founder of Sounding Board, just over three years to recognize the value of executive coaching and get her company to a Series A.\n\nHere\u2019s how she did it.\n\nNFTs could bridge video games and the fashion industry\n\nMusic companies, celebrities and fashion brands are some of the latest entities to dip a toe into the burgeoning NFT market.\n\nIn part two of a three-part series, we take a look at why NFTs are \u201cthe next chapter of digital art history.\u201d\n\nWhere is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?\n\nThe pandemic-induced growth of e-commerce is, by now, well documented.\n\nWhat is happening in the app ecosystem that supports e-commerce? Is it growing, or are we more likely to see consolidations and IPOs?\n\nLet\u2019s explore.\n\nironSource is going public via a SPAC and its numbers are pretty good\n\nYou\u2019ll want to pay attention to this one: Israel\u2019s ironSource, an app-monetization startup, is going public via a SPAC.\n\nIt\u2019s the second SPAC-led debut from an Israeli company in recent weeks worth more than $10 billion, and ironSource is actually a pretty darn interesting company from a financial perspective.\n\nCoursera set to roughly double its private valuation in impending IPO\n\nThe market views Coursera\u2019s edtech business warmly ahead of its impending public offering.\n\nCoursera is being valued as a software company, likely a breathe-easy moment for still-private edtech companies, since the debut could be an industry bellwether."}
