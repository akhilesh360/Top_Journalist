Now, as Alan announces its expansion to Canada, the startup is about to break a new record: There hasn\u2019t been a new health insurance company in Canada since 1957.\n\nIn many ways, Alan treats health insurance as software as a service. It\u2019s a subscription-first product that can be optimized with technology. For instance, Alan has built its own claim management system. Its flagship product is health insurance that complements the national healthcare system in France. French companies must provide health insurance to all their employees when they join.\n\nThe startup has also added additional services to improve consumer satisfaction, reduce churn, and win new deals. Alan members can use the company\u2019s mobile app, for example, to chat with doctors, order prescription glasses, and consume preventive care content on mental health or back pain.\n\nWhile the company has raised a ton of money \u2014 including a recently announced \u20ac173 million Series F round \u2014 Alan has been relatively focused when it comes to geographic coverage. In addition to its home country, the service is also available in Belgium and Spain.\n\nIt\u2019s such a big market, however, that it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to launch everywhere to find new clients. It currently covers 675,000 people across its three markets. Given that nearly 100% of the population in France, Belgium, and Spain has a health insurance contract, Alan is still a challenger.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t seemed to stop Alan\u2019s expansion plans. The company has obtained a federal OFSI license in Canada, meaning that it can officially operate as an insurance company in the country. It\u2019s building a local board and a local team with insurance and healthcare experts.\n\n\u201cYou cannot use your European license in Canada. You need to apply for a new license. But then the rules in terms of solvency, distribution, risk management, and so on are very, very similar,\u201d Alan co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (pictured above) told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Part of the reason can be found on Alan\u2019s capitalization table. Teachers\u2019 Venture Growth (TVG), the venture fund of the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan Board, led Alan\u2019s Series E round. But with Canada, Alan wanted to make a statement.\n\n\u201cI try to be very long-term oriented in the way we make our decisions at Alan. And when I picture Alan in 10 years from now, I don\u2019t see us just as a European company. I see us as a global company,\u201d Samuelian-Werve said.\n\nCanada is also a fairly large market, with both a national healthcare system and private health insurance coverage. Primary care is covered by the government, but a good portion of healthcare, around $60 billion a year, is handled by health insurance providers. And things haven\u2019t changed much lately.\n\n\u201cIn Canada, there are only 20 [health insurance providers] that have at least 1% in market share. That number is 400 in France \u2026 It\u2019s really, really uncompetitive [in Canada],\u201d Alan\u2019s general manager for Canada, Mark Goad, said. \u201cAnd if you look at the satisfaction ratings with the net promoter score, it\u2019s at -8 in Canada, whereas Alan operates at +70.\u201d\n\nJust like in France, the Canadian team is going to distribute Alan through employers. Employers typically pick one health insurance provider to cover the entire workforce of that company.\n\nAround 55 Canadian companies have already expressed interest in trying Alan. The company plans to onboard one customer per week starting in January 2025. It will then launch its self-signup portal at some point during the second quarter of 2025."}
