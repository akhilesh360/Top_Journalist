According to a social post by CEO Brian Armstrong, the hackers demanded $20 million from the company.\n\nThe company said the hacker stole customer names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and the last four digits of users\u2019 Social Security numbers. The hacker also took masked bank account numbers and some banking identifiers, as well as customers\u2019 government-issued identity documents, such as driver\u2019s licenses and passports. The stolen data also includes account balance data and transaction histories.\n\nThe company said some corporate data, such as internal documentation, was also stolen during the breach.\n\nIn a blog post, Coinbase said it was opening a new U.S.-based support hub and will strengthen its security defenses.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Coinbase spokesperson Natasha LaBranche told TechCrunch that the number of affected customers is less than 1% of its 9.7 million monthly customers, per the company\u2019s latest annual report ending March 2025.\n\nCoinbase said it expects to incur costs of around $180 million to $400 million relating to incident remediation and customer reimbursements.\n\nDo you work at Coinbase and know more about the breach?
