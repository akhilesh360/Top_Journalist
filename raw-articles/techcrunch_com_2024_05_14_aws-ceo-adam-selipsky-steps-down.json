Garman previously headed AWS\u2019 EC2 cloud computing org.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team,\u201d Jassy wrote. \u201cAdam is now going to move onto his next challenge (after taking a well-deserved respite), and Garman will become CEO of AWS, effective June 3rd.\u201d\n\nSelipsky was one of the first VPs Amazon hired at AWS in 2005, and spent 11 years heading up sales, marketing and support before leaving to become CEO of data visualization software Tableau. He returned to Amazon in 2021 to lead AWS.\n\nBefore running EC2, Garman \u2014 who joined AWS in 2006 as one of the first product managers \u2014 eventually became the general manager of all AWS compute services in 2016. In 2020, he moved to the \u201cdemand generation\u201d side of AWS to spearhead worldwide sales, marketing support and professional services.\n\nIn a statement to employees, Selipsky wrote, \u201cgiven the state of the business and the leadership team, now is an appropriate moment for me to make this transition, and to take the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities.\u201d\n\nSelipsky is perceived as having missed the boat on generative AI \u2014 which might\u2019ve contributed to his ouster.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But technical issues forced the organization to postpone the launch.\n\nUnder Selipsky, AWS also passed on opportunities to back two leading generative AI startups, Cohere and Anthropic. AWS later tried to invest in Cohere, but was rejected \u2014 and had to settle for a co-investment (albeit a large one) in Anthropic with rival Google.\n\nIn the memo, Jassy highlighted Selipsky\u2019s accomplishments, saying that Selipsky \u201ctook over in the middle of the pandemic\u201d and \u201cmade the right long-term decision to help customers become more efficient in their spend, even if it meant less short-term revenue for AWS.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam leaves AWS in a strong position, having reached a $100 billion annual revenue run rate this past quarter, with YoY revenue accelerating again,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m deeply appreciative of Adam\u2019s leadership during this time, and for the entire team\u2019s dedication to deliver for customers and the business.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, AWS\u2019 unit revenue growth slowed to record lows, and AWS underwent major layoffs as part of broader cuts at Amazon that resulted in more than 27,000 employees being let go.\n\nYet AWS remains the cloud leader with around 31% market share (versus Microsoft Azure\u2019s 25% and Google Cloud\u2019s 11%) and one of Amazon\u2019s most profitable business divisions.\n\nIn the most recent fiscal quarter, AWS generated $9.42 billion in operating income, or about 62% of Amazon\u2019s total. Jassy recently said AWS\u2019 generative AI businesses alone have hit a combined \u201cmulti-billion dollar run rate.\u201d"}
