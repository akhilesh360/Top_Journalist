VCs have backed for-profit education companies in the past, including Coursera and Udacity, but backing a more traditional two-year college is different. Plus, he was looking for funds a few years ago when higher ed was starting to face a reckoning from decreasing enrollment and increasing tuition prices.\n\nOyerinde said on a recent episode of TechCrunch\u2019s Found podcast that despite the difficulty he thought it still made sense to turn to venture capitalists for funding for a few reasons. Campus runs off of CampusWire, online learning software that Oyerinde built prior to launching Campus, making it software-enabled and relatively lean. He added that while Campus may not look like the average software or edtech startup, he thought the fact that he was disrupting a legacy industry would align perfectly with VCs.\n\n\u201cIt was like a high risk, high reward, massive problem,\u201d Oyerinde said. \u201cIf you can solve it, [there\u2019s a] massive opportunity to make this country stronger and better. If you capture a small sliver of the market, you can build a massive company. So it just made a lot of sense to go to venture.\u201d\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean it was easy. Oyerinde said his initial mistake was trying to find and pitch as many investors as he could to convince them to invest in him. Once he shifted his approach and sought out investors that had interest or experience with the community college space, fundraising started to get a little easier.\n\nSome of the startup\u2019s first investors were OpenAI founder Sam Altman and Discord founder Jason Citron. They understood the need for innovation in the community college space because both of them had spent time at community colleges.\n\nWhile he was building CampusWire, Oyerinde got connected with Citron through Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures. Citron participated in Campus\u2019s seed round and later connected Oyerinde with Altman. Oyerinde said he\u2019s glad he caught Altman before ChatGPT and joked it\u2019s probably a little more challenging to get a meeting with him now.\n\nOyerinde said another reason he thinks it resonated with them is that while technology continues to evolve, community college largely looks the same, meaning students may not learn what they need to know to keep up. Because of Campus\u2019 ties to startups and Silicon Valley, it\u2019s closer to cutting-edge tech and can adjust its curriculum to meets trends faster than a regular community college might be able to.\n\n\u201cDo you really think that these traditional community colleges are going to adapt quickly enough to be responsive to the changing landscape? Probably not,\u201d Oyerinde said. \u201cSo there needs to be this highly adaptive, highly thoughtful, tech-enabled, tech-focused experience that\u2019s more efficient, accessible and successful [at] actually helping kids complete. And so, they were really excited.\u201d\n\nCampus has raised more than $55 million in venture funding. This includes a $29 million Series A round led by Altman and Citron in May 2023 and a more recent $23 million Series A extension round led by Founders Fund in April. Oyerinde joked that yes, even anti-college Peter Thiel could still see the potential here.\n\nThe startup\u2019s recent funding rounds are particularly notable because of the current state of the edtech sector which has definitely fallen out of favor with VCs since its pandemic boom. More than $38 billion was invested in edtech startups globally in 2020 and 2021, according to Crunchbase data. But that momentum didn\u2019t last. Through June 11 of this year, edtech startups had raised a little over a billion, meaning the sector will likely see its lowest funding total in years in 2024. Existing edtech players don\u2019t appear to be doing well either. Companies like Byju\u2019s, once valued at $22 billion, recently raised a round that cut its valuation down to between $20 million and $25 million.\n\nBut Oyerinde isn\u2019t deterred. While fundraising was tough at first, it\u2019s gotten easier and the startup gets inbound interest now. Oyerinde credits that change in tune to the fact that he thinks Campus is doing something truly innovative in a legacy, and largely untouched, category, the type of disruption that is generally music to VCs\u2019 ears.\n\n\u201cWe want this to fundamentally change the way people learn in America, and eventually the world,\u201d Oyerinde said. \u201cSilicon Valley is still the place you go if you want funding for moonshots, and that\u2019s exactly what Campus was.\u201d"}
