The stolen data also includes information about types of patients and medical record numbers.\n\nLocal media quoted the healthcare system\u2019s spokesperson as saying that the number of affected individuals \u201cmay change.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the nature of the cyberattack by TechCrunch, Yale New Haven spokesperson Dana Marnane did not dispute that the incident was related to ransomware.\n\n\u201cThe sophistication of the attack leads us to believe that it was executed by an individual or group who has a pattern of these types of incidents,\u201d said Marnane, declining to comment further to TechCrunch, citing an ongoing law enforcement investigation.\n\nThe healthcare provider declined to say if it had any communication with the hackers, or if the hackers made a demand for payment.\n\nAs of press time, no major ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the hack. It\u2019s not uncommon for ransomware and data extortion gangs to publish a victim\u2019s stolen files when negotiations to pay the ransom demand fail.\n\nThis is the second major healthcare data breach confirmed this week, after Blue Shield of California revealed it shared health data of 4.7 million patients with Google over several years.\n\nUpdated with comment and additional details related to ransomware."}
