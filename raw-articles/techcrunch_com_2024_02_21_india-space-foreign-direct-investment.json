The new foreign direct investment (FDI) policy raises limits on foreign investment, potentially spurring renewed interest in the South Asian space community.\n\nPrivate and public actors in India have been taking measures to increase participation in the country\u2019s space sector. India\u2019s space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), has also made significant strides in the last few months to gain global attention, including the successful moon landing of its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft and partnership with NASA over joining Artemis Accords. However, the restrictions in foreign direct investments limited the country\u2019s scope to attract international investors and caused a delay in funding of some of India\u2019s growing space tech startups.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Indian cabinet, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved an amendment in its FDI norms to allow increased overseas investment in the space sector, in some cases up to 100%. The Indian government has defined three different categories under the amended policy:\n\nUp to 49% (foreign ownership) for launch vehicles and associated systems and subsystems, creation of spaceports for launching and receiving spacecraft.\n\nUp to 74% for satellite manufacturing and operation, satellite data products and ground segment and user segment.\n\nUp to 100% for manufacturing components and systems and subsystems for satellites, ground segment and user segment.\n\nForeign investments beyond the given thresholds need government approval.\n\nIn June 2020, the Indian government passed its space sector reforms and founded a new agency, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center, to enable private companies to use ISRO resources and infrastructure.\n\nLast year, the country also introduced its space policy to detail guidelines and rules for private participation. New Delhi additionally replaced its century-old rules with a new telecom act to enable the ground for global satellite-based broadband service providers, including Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink.\n\nIndia has around 190 space tech startups, offering such solutions as launch vehicles, space situational awareness and hyperspectral imagery. Investments in Indian space startups reached over $124 million last year, per government data. The country\u2019s space economy is projected to reach $44 billion by 2033 (from $8.4 billion last year).\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
