Central to that concept is turning off notifications, uninstalling work apps or even \u2014 if you\u2019re feeling especially brave \u2014 leaving the phone at home for a week or two. But is paradise truly paradise if you can\u2019t check your work email the entire time? Who\u2019s to say, really?\n\nIridium \u2014 the satellite service that recently teamed up with Qualcomm for SOS messaging on Android \u2014 today announced the Go Exec, a new mobile hotspot designed to bring the internet with you basically anywhere. There are, of course, plenty of folks who could benefit from such always-on connectivity \u2014 first responders, sailors and pilots come to mind \u2014 but as the name suggests, the company is also appealing to the real heroes: corporate executives. I suppose there\u2019s an argument that some people at the head of organizations simply can\u2019t afford to unplug for a full week \u2014 at the very least, it\u2019s useful to have some connection to the outside world, in case of emergency.\n\nThe system is an update to 2014\u2019s Iridium Go. It\u2019s more compact and lighter, while providing faster speeds than its predecessor, with up to 22 Kbps up and 88 Kbps second down. Not blazing fast speeds here by any means, but we\u2019re talking about bringing internet access to places where there is none. The system can stream up to two voice calls at once, and has a mic and speaker built-in to double as a speakerphone.\n\n\u201cCompact\u201d is also a bit relative for this space. The device measures 8 x 8 x 1 inches and weighs 4.6 pounds. On second thought, it might be a bit much to take up that mountain with you. \u201cCheaper,\u201d too, is relative. Currently resellers are offering the product at $1,500-$2,000.\n\nThe on-board battery offers up to six hours of voice/data usage or 24 hours of standby time. Iridium says the following apps \u201cpair well\u201d with the device: WhatsApp, Viber, Line, Signal, Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Twitter, Opera, Venmo and Google Home. Iridium also has a custom email client designed for use with the product, along with an API for app developers. In addition, Iridium is offering an external antenna specifically designed for remote locales."}
