Muse is trained on game developer Ninja Theory\u2019s multiplayer battle arena game Bleeding Edge. It can understand the 3D game world, including game physics and how the game reacts to players\u2019 controller actions, allowing the model to create gameplay rendered by AI.\n\nIn a separate announcement last May, Microsoft said it was working to embed Copilot into video games, starting with Minecraft. The company showed Copilot responding to questions like \u201cHow do I craft a sword?\u201d in-game, searching a player\u2019s inventory for the necessary materials, and instructing the player on how to obtain key missing components.\n\nIn another bid to boost engagement, Microsoft has reportedly been experimenting with \u201ccharacter-based\u201d Copilot features. In January, reverse engineer Alexey Shabanov discovered two animated characters in Copilot designed to interact with users through sound effects and animations."}
