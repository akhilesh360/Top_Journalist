He was surprised to find a market filled with different single-use tools.\n\n\u201cIt was a very frustrating experience,\u201d Cho told TechCrunch. \u201cI had to learn and juggle all these different tools. It felt like a very inefficient way of getting your word out to users. I\u2019ve always been fascinated about how to make marketing a bit more efficient and effective.\u201d\n\nCho (pictured above on the left) sat on this idea for a few years while working on engineering teams at companies such as Meta, Affirm, and Fast. After the advancements in generative AI in 2022, he realized he might be able to solve the marketing problems he had years earlier using AI.\n\n\n\nThe result was Tofu, an AI-driven B2B marketing platform that\u2019s designed to bring all of a company\u2019s potential marketing campaigns into one space. The platform integrates with a marketing team\u2019s existing workflow, and tools like HubSpot and Salesforce, and uses AI to automatically modify marketing copy for different marketing channels and can personalize marketing content for different customer types.\n\nCho, Tofu co-founder and CEO, said that while he ran into his frustrations with marketing tools while building a consumer-facing company, he decided to focus on B2B marketing because it is significantly more text heavy than B2C marketing, which made it a more natural choice for a generative AI approach.\n\nTofu\u2019s team consulted more than 40 different CMOs before writing any code, Cho said, to figure out what their biggest pain points were. The two areas that came up most consistently were that CMOs wanted to be able to personalize content across different market segments and to repurpose content for different channels. Cho said that\u2019s where Tofu focused first.\n\nTofu combines multiple marketing tools into one using AI.

The company boasts 12x revenue growth, although it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s only been in operation for a little over a year. Customers include DeepScribe, Check Point, and Wunderkind, among others.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Jasper, which helps enterprise companies with AI-driven marketing, has been around for a decade and is valued at more than $1.5 billion. Cordial, another cross-channel marketing platform, has raised more than $70 million in venture funding.\n\nCho acknowledged that the space is crowded but added that he thinks Tofu is in a good position because it touches so many different teams within a marketing department, compared to a single-use tool. That makes it stickier than some of Tofu\u2019s other competitors, he said. The fact that Tofu isn\u2019t just a ChatGPT wrapper and offers an integrated end-to-end solution makes them stand out, he added.\n\nNow that Tofu has closed its Series A round, the company is going expand the product\u2019s capabilities as it works toward building a source of truth for marketing teams.\n\n\u201cIt is a noisy space,\u201d Cho said. \u201cThe way we position ourselves is to basically say we replace and can support the multiple use cases you\u2019re purchasing individual tools for with one platform. So that unified platform is a very appealing value proposition for customers, especially enterprise customers.\u201d"}
