During this time, the bad actor was able to access and view all user accounts,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nThe hacker, according to Roll20, \u201cmay have been able to view\u201d users\u2019 personal information, including full name, email address, last-known IP address, and the last four digits of their credit card, if the user had stored a payment method on their account. The company added that the hacker did not have access to passwords or full payment information like home addresses and full credit card numbers.\n\nRoll20 said it is notifying users of the breach. Several users shared screenshots of the email notification on social media. A TechCrunch reporter also received the same notification.\n\nRoll20 spokesperson Jayme Boucher did not respond to a series of questions from TechCrunch, including how many users in total were affected, how many users had their last four digits of their credit card stolen, how the hacker gained access to the administrative account, and whether the company has any information on who the hacker or hackers were.\n\nRoll20 says on its website that it has 12 million users and that it\u2019s \u201cthe No. 1 choice for D&D online.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Although we have no evidence that any of the data is being misused, and no passwords or card numbers were exposed, we believe in the importance of being transparent with our users about any potential exposure of their personal information,\u201d Boucher told TechCrunch in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re still investigating and don\u2019t have further details to share at this time beyond what we shared in our email notification. We prioritized being as transparent as possible as quickly as possible, and that\u2019s why we notified users today.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, TechCrunch reported that a hacker had stolen more than 600 million records from 24 websites, including Roll20. The hacker listed 4 million records from the company at the time."}
