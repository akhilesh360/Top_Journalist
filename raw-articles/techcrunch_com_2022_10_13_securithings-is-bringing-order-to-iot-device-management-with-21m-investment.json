SecuriThings has built a solution to solve this problem with a platform that helps building operations understand and control what\u2019s happening on physical security devices across a company.\n\nToday the company announced a $21 million Series B.\n\nRoy Dagan, company CEO and co-founder, says that while companies are spending inordinate amounts of money on this equipment, they often don\u2019t know if they are even working because they lack visibility. \u201cWe built the ultimate system to help them automate the management of these devices at scale, and really provide the equivalent of an IT type of system for managing these kinds of devices,\u201d Dagan told TechCrunch.\n\nThe system automates a bunch of management tasks that are typically done manually, including firmware upgrades, managing certificates and rotating passwords. What\u2019s more, it can help find and troubleshoot issues with these devices as they happen.\n\n\u201cIt can also perform things like root cause analysis. So we can tell when an issue occurs, and we can tell you what\u2019s at fault,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou may think it\u2019s a [camera], but it\u2019s actually a switch and it\u2019s affecting 15 [cameras], which are all down.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a problem because while building operations manages the broken cameras, the broken switch is under the purview of IT, and they need to know about it to fix it. SecuriThings includes ways to communicate with IT about these issues.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

So it can be integrated with ServiceNow or other ticketing systems\u2026and that helps you also start working better with the rest of the enterprise,\u201d Dagan said.\n\nHe believes that in spite of the economic uncertainty we are seeing, his company is well positioned to deal with it. \u201cOne of the cool business outcomes is really around cost reduction. Because if you look at the enterprise, and you look at the amount of spend they have today on these devices, and the way things are done manually and reactively, it\u2019s almost a no brainer. The cost savings are huge,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he wouldn\u2019t discuss revenue growth, he said the company currently has dozens of customers using the platform and the number of customers has grown over 300% year over year.\n\nThe startup currently has 70 employees, with plans to add more with the new investment. He says that being diverse is built into the company\u2019s values. \u201cSo it\u2019s just part of our culture, and it\u2019s core to the company. It really is, and just looking at stats that we have today where 40% of leadership is female, and 40% of the company is female\u2026But then also our HR team is constantly evaluating the numbers and looking at different opportunities and how we create that diversity even more,\u201d he said.\n\nToday\u2019s investment was led by U.S. Venture Partners (USVP) and participation from Swisscom Ventures and existing investors Aleph, Firstime VC and Cresson Management. The startup reports it has now raised a total of $39 million."}
