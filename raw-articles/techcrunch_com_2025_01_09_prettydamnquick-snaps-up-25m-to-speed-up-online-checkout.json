PrettyDamnQuick (PDQ) provides tech to retailers to let them customize and test different shipping and checkout flows, and now it has picked up a deal of its own: a $25 million Series A to expand its business.\n\nWith some 200 customers already on its books since it was founded in 2020, New York-based PDQ says it currently processes around 30 million orders each month. That works out to $4 billion in gross merchandise volume to date, and the company projects that it will process 300 million orders by the end of 2025.\n\nPDQ\u2019s fundraise and growth come at a time when many have been watching to see what will happen with the e-commerce industry overall.\n\nAfter a very strong period of rapid growth following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of companies and investors saw demand dropping off drastically as people went back to brick-and-mortar stores for shopping. It didn\u2019t help that people also bought less due to inflation and economic uncertainty.\n\nFor those looking for optimism, recent figures from the latest holiday shopping period were a mixed bag: There were some extremely strong shopping days, but these punctuated a period that actually delivered lower growth than forecasters expected.\n\nCompanies like PDQ might still benefit, however: Giving shoppers better discounts without cutting too much into retailer\u2019s margins might be more welcome than ever.\n\nThe crux of the problem that PDQ is solving is a classic one for independent e-commerce retailers.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Some who really want to outsource the technology layer of their operations might opt for a solution like Amazon, where they can list their goods on Amazon\u2019s marketplace and use its search algorithms, fulfilment, shipping, loyalty programs and other tools to handle the rest of the process for a fee. These days, there are other third-party options, too, including the likes of Temu, Instagram, TikTok, and more.\n\nPDQ is targeting e-commerce companies that would rather build their own online presence. It speaks to a spirit of independence that has spurred the growth of companies like Shopify, which helps build online storefronts easily, and Stripe, which manages customers\u2019 transactions.\n\nPDQ is addressing another critical area in that chain: How these sites set up and manage the wider checkout experience, which can include shipping costs and methods, as well as other kinds of deals to lure shoppers into buying more.\n\nAvi Moskowitz, PDQ\u2019s CEO and founder, said he first came up with the idea for the startup by way of his own experience of starting and running a craft brewing business in Israel.\n\nThe company, called BeerBazaar, launched in 2015, and in early 2020, \u201cnot really anticipating what would be coming,\u201d Moskowitz decided that it made sense for them to build a website. The company used Shopify to do so.\n\nThen, just weeks later, COVID-19 arrived.\n\n\u201cSuddenly we were shipping hundreds of orders a day, some days over 1,000 orders,\u201d he recalled. What should have felt like an exciting boom in business quickly turned into a nightmare. Both his company and its customers \u201cwere shocked by the lack of this Amazon-like experience that we had been so used to.\u201d\n\nMoskowitz and his team set out to try to fix this for BeerBazaar to give its users \u201cthe same trust and confidence\u201d to shop on its site that they might have on Amazon: Predicable information about shipping and its costs, perhaps offers to bring down the cost of shipping, or remove it altogether.\n\n\u201cAs we began to solve it for ourselves, we realized that like many of the tools that started emerging in e-commerce, like personalization and optimization and A/B testing, it really does require a platform,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about a particular feature. If you\u2019re going to be able to optimize in checkout, it means being able to manage the entire customer journey, from the moment they enter your store, all the way through checkout, fulfilment, tracking and delivery.\u201d\n\nAfter building that platform, Moskowitz thought it was a strong enough idea to sell to others, too, and thus PDQ was born. Today, the company is only able to integrate with online stores that have been built on Shopify, Moskowitz said, but the plan is to use some of the funding to expand to cover other sites.\n\nPDQ\u2019s main objective is personalization, Moskowitz said: \u201cBasically every shopper is able to experience the checkout that\u2019s appropriate for them.\u201d\n\nIf a retailer already has order management, shipping and payment partners, it orchestrates those activities on a single platform. For those who do not fulfill orders in-house or have fulfillment partners (third-party logistics, or 3PL, partners) in place, PDQ provides an interface to work with a large range of big carriers (USPS, DHL, FedEx, UPS, etc.) as well as a variety of smaller delivery companies and other 3PL providers.\n\nOther areas that it provides tooling for include checkout, order tracking and protection after a purchase has been made, and A/B testing when a retailer wants to try out different offers at checkout.\n\nThere are, of course, other companies addressing this aspect of the e-commerce flow, including Shopify itself, along with many of the partners that PDQ integrates with. As with other aspects of e-commerce geared at addressing what is a highly fragmented market, it\u2019s likely that there will be multiple players building strong offerings that will coexist.\n\nThe real competition are platforms like Amazon and the ones offering the other alternative to retailers: migrating to larger marketplaces to remove the need to think about independent products altogether.\n\nThe company has so far raised $38 million, and it is not disclosing its valuation with this latest round, which was led by new investor PeakSpan Capital. Previous backers TLV Partners and Moneta also participated."}
