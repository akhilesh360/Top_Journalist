Activant claimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debt by borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back.\n\nThe case was eventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant\u2019s shares for $37 million last year.\n\nSpeaking at Fintech Meetup in Las Vegas yesterday, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was.\n\nHe said he opted for the loan instead of selling his stock in a secondaries transaction and that the loan was unanimously approved by Bolt\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cIt was done to be pro-Bolt,\u201d Breslow said. \u201cI took it out instead of selling any meaningful secondaries. I wanted to show all of our investors that I\u2019m keeping all my chips in, I believe so much in the stock that I\u2019m not selling my shares.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

He said that after he left the CEO role, the board called in the loan, which he viewed as \u201ca bit of an attack.\u201d\n\nBreslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. In the years between then and his return this year, he has also faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company.\n\nOn Monday, Breslow admitted he made \u201ca ton of mistakes\u201d \u2014 but said they were not the ones he was accused of. He viewed his main mistake as allowing people to join Bolt\u2019s cap table that he \u201cdid not know very well\u201d (without specifying who).\n\n\u2018Super app\u2019 in the works\n\nNow that he\u2019s back as CEO, he says Bolt will soon be launching a new \u201csuper app\u201d that will integrate Bolt\u2019s one-click checkout e-commerce experience across a wide array of services.\n\n\u201cInstead of one-click checkout, we\u2019re going to have one-click everything: financial services, peer-to-peer, crypto, cards, financial products, all in one app,\u201d he said.\n\nBreslow compared Bolt to U.K. fintech Revolut, which was valued at $45 billion last year, claiming Bolt has 80 million \u201cwallets\u201d compared to Revolut\u2019s 45 million, although he admitted Bolt has not \u201cmonetized our consumers yet.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Bolt\u2019s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reported last year. That\u2019s small compared to Revolut, which announced $2.2 billion in revenue and $545 million in profits (before tax) for 2023 alone.\n\nThe big question remaining about Bolt is the status of its next fundraise. In August, news broke about a pending $450 million fundraise deal. But it raised questions over its unusual use of $250 million in \u201cmarketing credits\u201d and lack of confirmation from an investor mistakenly identified as its lead.\n\nSome of Bolt\u2019s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbes reported, but that has been voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Bolt announced today.\n\nBreslow noted during his speech that \u201call\u201d the legal cases against him are \u201cfully settled, dismissed\u201d but didn\u2019t provide an update on the $450 million fundraise.\n\nHe did comment, though, that he\u2019s been \u201chumbled\u201d by his experience and has found a newfound determination to run Bolt after his faith and himself \u2014 and his startup \u2014 was challenged.\n\n\u201cYou know, I obviously make mistakes but I\u2019ve got a very big chip on my shoulder,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take Bolt to really new heights.\u201d\n\nBlackRock and Hedosophia didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment."}
