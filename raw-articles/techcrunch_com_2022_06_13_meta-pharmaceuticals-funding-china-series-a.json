The Shenzhen-based company, which sets out to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases with the help of artificial intelligence, has raised $15 million from its seed and pre-A rounds.\n\nThere is no lack of investor interest in companies applying machine learning to small-molecule drug discovery. New York-based Immunai picked up $215 million last year to create an \u201catlas\u201d of the human immune system. Insilico from Hong Kong recently landed $60 million despite undergoing what the CEO dubbed a \u201cbiotech winter.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s technology falls under the emerging field of immuno-metabolism, which studies the relationship between the historically distinct disciplines of immunology and metabolism. Drugs created using this new method are purported to regulate the immune system more effectively with fewer side effects. Originally from southwestern China, Meta\u2019s co-founder and CEO Xu Ke graduated from Weill Cornell Medicine and conducted research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, one of the top cancer hospitals in the U.S.\n\nMeta is merely 10 months old but is built off the back of an industry incumbent. It\u2019s a project \u201cincubated\u201d by AI-assisted drug discovery and development upstart Xtalpi, which was founded in 2014 and has raised nearly $800 million in funding to date from the likes of Tencent, Softbank Vision Fund and Sequoia Capital China.\n\nInvestors from Meta\u2019s financing rounds included Xtalpi itself, Forcefield Ventures, IMO Venture and Tiantu Capital.\n\nMeta and Xtalpi clearly play complementary roles to each other by working to translate new drug targets into patents and marketable products. Meta\u2019s proposed therapeutic targets will first go to XtalPi for drug discovery or de novo drug design, which refers to computer-assisted molecular design. Once a pre-clinical candidate is identified, Meta may take over to carry out subsequent development, investigational new drug (IND) filing, and clinical trials, an Xtalpi spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nMeta claims to have already discovered a series of metabolic protease targets after sifting through thousands of proteases on its AI-enabled target discovery platform.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In its infancy, the zone is one of many government-led initiatives to promote technological collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Support for startups comes in various forms and in Meta\u2019s case, it means tax exemption on imported lab equipment. The area is also home to Xtalpi and one of China\u2019s largest autonomous driving startups Deeproute.ai."}
