(It runs Android 11 out of the box.)\n\nThe startup also hopes to be able to extend the phone\u2019s lifespan even further \u2014 saying its goal is software support until 2027 and upgrades to Android 14 and 15 too.\n\nThe new flagship follows the launch of the Fairphone 3+ last year \u2014 which enabled owners of its prior top-of-the-range handset to upgrade to for as little as \u20ac70 just by swapping out a few modules.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Or else take back and refurbish at least one other phone to prevent the production of a new one.\n\nIn another development toward its ambitious goal of making truly sustainable and ethical personal electronics, Fairphones notes that it\u2019s been able to expand its list of fairly obtained materials, adding six new ones. In the Fairphone 4 these include Fairtrade-certified gold, aluminium from Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) Performance Standard certified vendors, fair tungsten from Rwanda, recycled tin, rare earth minerals and plastics.\n\nConsumers have long been holding onto smartphones for considerably longer than upgrade cycles of the early years of the market as the space has matured and device refreshes have become increasingly iterative.\n\nSimultaneously environmental concerns are also stepping up driving changes in how consumers buy and use mobile devices. So the new shiny thing, in consumer demand terms, might actually be keeping the old shiny thing for as long as possible and responsibly recycling it when it finally comes to the end of its run.\n\nIn Europe, lawmakers are also considering right to repair legislation.\n\nFairphone\u2019s modular design, which allows the user to easily swap out and replace components (like the screen, battery and camera) if a part of the device breaks or malfunctions, may provide a glimpse of the future of consumer electronics \u2014 if regulators go down the path of mandating repairability in order to tackle e-waste and incentivize reduced consumption as part of measures to decarbonize the economy and respond to the climate crisis.\n\nCommenting on the launch of the Fairphone 4 in a statement, Eva Gouwens, CEO of Fairphone, said: \u201cWe want to challenge the traditional way of designing devices, including the notion that thinner is better. The starting point in development was to produce a premium sustainable smartphone that is future-proof, easily repairable, designed to last and therefore more circular and fair.\u201d\n\nThe tech specs of Fairphone\u2019s latest device have also had a boost vs the previous flagship \u2014 so as well as 5G the phone comes with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G chipset, beefed up rear & front cameras and a 6.3-inch display, among other tweaks."}
