The company announced this week that it has raised $80 million (KRW 108.5 billion) in a Series C round at a valuation of $529 million (KRW 723 billion), which has surged more than eight times from its Series B funding, about $15 million, in 2021.\n\nThe Series C funding, which brings its total raise to around $95 million, will go toward mass production of the startup\u2019s inaugural products \u2014 DX-V1, DX-V3, DX-M1 and DX-H1 \u2014 in late 2024 for global distribution. The startup will also use the new capital to expedite developing and launching its next generation of large language model (LLM) on-device solutions.\n\nDEEPX was founded in 2018 by CEO Lokwon Kim, who previously worked at Apple, Cisco Systems, the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and Broadcom.\n\nThe market size of global edge AI, also called on-device AI, is projected to reach $107.47 billion by 2029, up from $11.98 billion in 2021, according to a recent report. \u201cThe on-device AI market, excluding edge servers, requires AI capabilities to be implemented, bypassing servers or the cloud,\u201d Kim told TechCrunch. \u201cThe [on-device AI market] is expanding due to computer vision capabilities like facial and voice recognition, smart mobility, robotics, the internet of things and physical security systems.\u201d\n\nKim said that if its mass production begins this year, potential customers such as end-product manufacturers will be able to commercialize their products with DEEPX\u2019s AI chips in 2025.\n\nDEEPX, which has around 65 employees, is not the only company that has developed AI chip solutions. The Korean outfit competes with Hailo, which landed a $120 million funding round last month; SiMa.ai, which closed on $70 million, also in April; and Axelera, a Belgium-based AI chip startup that secured $27 million in 2022.\n\nKim said that his company\u2019s differentiators include cost efficiency, energy consumption efficiency and All-in-4 AI Total Solution, a comprehensive solution for various AI applications. Its All-in-4 AI solutions include: DX-V1 and DX-V3, designed for vision systems in home appliances, surveillance camera systems, robot vision and drones; as well as DX-M1 and DX-H1, which are designed for AI computing boxes, AI servers, smart factories and AI booster chips. DEEPX now has more than 259 patents pending in the U.S., China and South Korea, Kim said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

AJU IB and previous backer Timefolio Asset Management also participated in this round."}
