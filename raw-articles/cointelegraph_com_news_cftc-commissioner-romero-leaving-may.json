Her departure will come a day after Commissioner Summer Mersinger is expected to step down to join the crypto advocacy organization the Blockchain Association as CEO.\n\n\u201cIt has been a tremendous honor to conclude my 23 years of federal service at an agency with such an important mission to ensure that financial markets perform their critical role in the US and global economies,\u201d said Romero.\n\nRomero and Mersinger\u2019s upcoming departures would leave the CFTC with only two Senate-confirmed members: acting chair Caroline Pham and Commissioner Kristin Johnson, each taking one Republican and Democratic seat, respectively. However, Pham also announced that she planned to leave after Quintenz\u2019s confirmation. The shakeup in leadership potentially gives President Donald Trump the opportunity to pick three more commissioners after the Senate addresses Quintenz\u2019s nomination.\n\nRelated: Former CFTC lawyer says agency should take lead on memecoin regulations\n\nAssuming Quintenz, likely being positioned for one of the CFTC\u2019s Republican seats, is confirmed, Trump would still be able to radically change the leadership of the commission by choosing four of the five-member panel. CFTC rules require that no more than three commissioners belong to the same political party.\n\nCongress looking to clarify SEC, CFTC roles on crypto\n\nThe shakeup in leadership at one of the most significant US financial regulators came as lawmakers in the House were considering draft legislation that could establish a digital asset regulatory framework. The bill is expected to clarify oversight and enforcement authority of the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over many cryptocurrencies.\n\nDuring her time at the commission, starting in 2022, Romero helped establish the CFTC\u2019s Technology Advisory Committee, in part in response to addressing regulatory concerns from the crypto industry. She also supported a joint effort by US authorities against cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which resulted in a $2.7-billion settlement with the CFTC.\n\nMagazine: SEC\u2019s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered"}
