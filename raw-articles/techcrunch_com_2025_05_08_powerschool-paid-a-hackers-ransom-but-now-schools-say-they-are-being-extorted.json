As evidenced by past ransomware and extortion incidents, some gangs were later found to have retained huge amounts of stolen victim data, often to revictimize affected individuals with additional extortion attempts.\n\nIn a statement shared with customers this week, seen by TechCrunch, PowerSchool said it \u201crecently became aware that a threat actor has reached out to some PowerSchool SIS customers in an attempt to extort them using data\u201d from the December 2024 breach.\n\nBeth Keebler, a spokesperson for PowerSchool, told TechCrunch that the company does not think this is a new incident because \u201csamples of data match the data previously stolen in December.\u201d\n\nPowerSchool has not yet said how many individuals are affected by its data breach. Several school districts that used PowerSchool at the time of the breach told TechCrunch that \u201call\u201d of their historical student and teacher data was compromised\n\nIn the case of Toronto\u2019s school district, the stolen records date back to at least 2009 and are likely to affect millions of people."}
