The fundraise comes two years after the company raised a $40 million Series A.\n\nFounded over four years ago by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong (pictured above), former GV partner Blake Byers, and stem cell professor Jacob Kimmel, NewLimit claims it has made significant progress toward developing treatments that can restore youthful characteristics to aged cells.\n\nKimmel told TechCrunch the company has discovered three prototype medicines that reprogram liver cells. NewLimit\u2019s lab experiments, he said, demonstrate this rejuvenation can restore the cells\u2019 ability to process fat and alcohol.\n\nThe company measures its progress by contrasting how cells from a younger individual and an older person respond to the substances. An older liver cell that has gone through NewLimit\u2019s epigenetic reprogramming behaves more like a younger cell, Kimmel said.\n\nPromising early results notwithstanding, NewLimit is still a few years away from starting human trials.\n\nIn the meantime, the company wants to continue developing new anti-aging medicine using an AI model and then testing the most promising of these machine-generated drugs in its laboratory. \u201cWhat the AI model allows us to do is run all those experiments in simulation and then only follow up on the most promising subset,\u201d Kimmel said, adding that the data points from the experiment are then used to retrain the AI model in a process known as \u201clab in a loop.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
