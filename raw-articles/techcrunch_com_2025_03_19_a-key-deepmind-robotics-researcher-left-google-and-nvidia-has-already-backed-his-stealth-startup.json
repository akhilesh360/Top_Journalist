The panel was for portfolio companies of Nvidia\u2019s VC arm, NVentures.\n\nNVentures has become an especially active venture capital firm since Nvidia has enjoyed skyrocketing financial success in this new age of AI.\n\n\u201cWe are largely still in stealth,\u201d Florence told TechCrunch, explaining that the startup\u2019s mission is \u201cto make general-purpose robots a reality.\u201d\n\nFlorence left DeepMind a year ago, per his LinkedIn profile. DeepMind student researcher Kamyar Ghasemipour has also joined Generalist AI as a founding technical staff member, according to Ghasemipour\u2019s LinkedIn.\n\nFlorence joins a string of other DeepMind alums who have founded their own companies like autonomous coding startup Reflection AI, biotech startup Latent Labs, Mistral, and others.\n\nOutside of DeepMind but still within Alphabet, key leaders behind Google\u2019s viral NotebookLM product left to found their own AI startup late last year.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Work co-authored by Florence is cited four times in the paper announcing the models.\n\nFlorence said he couldn\u2019t specify exactly what his startup was up to during the GTC panel, but it\u2019s clear it will focus on robotics.\n\n\u201cWe are dead set on making robots that can do absolutely anything,\u201d Florence said in response to a question about what the world would look like if his startup was wildly successful.\n\n\u201cSo just imagine a world where the marginal cost of physical labor is driven to zero.\u201d\n\nNvidia declined to comment. Google didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment."}
