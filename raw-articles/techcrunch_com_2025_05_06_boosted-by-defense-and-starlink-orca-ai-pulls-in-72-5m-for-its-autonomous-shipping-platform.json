As a result, companies in this space are pushing on an open door. The latest is Orca AI, which closed a Series B funding round of $72.5 million led by Brighton Park Capital. Existing investors Ankona Capital and Hyperlink Ventures also participated. The London-based company has now raised over $111 million, including a $23 million funding round last year.\n\nSo what drove the new round? In a word: defense.\n\nFounded in 2018 by CEO Yarden Gross and CTO Dor Raviv, Orca AI applies AI-powered decision-making and autonomous capabilities to ships based on a marine visual dataset of over 80 million nautical miles. By employing AI in navigation, it\u2019s possible to significantly reduce collisions and allow crews to focus attention on other aspects of the voyage.\n\n\u201cThe main business still is in the commercial sector. We already have collaborations and POCs,\u201d Gross told TechCrunch. \u201cBut we see opportunities in defense coming from navies around the world around autonomy,\u201d he added, \u201cwhere they want more cost-effective assets that can operate more efficiently with less human intervention. We\u2019ve already signed the first contract in the defense field, deployed on a navy ship.\u201d\n\nOrca\u2019s growth is also benefiting from the expansion of Starlink, which allows real-time data to be transmitted to Orca AI for mapping routes, traffic monitoring, and sharing critical information.\n\n\u201cStarlink enables us to collect data at scale directly from the ship sensor. We see that as a huge opportunity,\u201d Gross said.\n\nThe company claims that a 2024 analysis of Orca AI\u2019s alerts system showed a 54% reduction in close-encounter events leading to an average of $100,000 savings in fuel per vessel per year.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
