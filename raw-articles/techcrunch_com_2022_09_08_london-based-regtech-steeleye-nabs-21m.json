This includes built-in search functionality to easily retrieve data upon request by a regulator or auditor, and full \u201ctrade reconstruction\u201d capabilities that can recreate the conditions around a specific trade or transaction.\n\nUltimately, SteelEye is all about preserving a full and accurate paper trail of everything that has gone in a heavily-regulated financial sector, and goes some way toward countering insider trading and other market abuses.\n\n\u201cFacing regulatory clampdowns, huge data volumes, and inflation impacts on budgets, financial firms need ways to reduce costs through efficiencies and automation,\u201d SteelEye CEO Matt Smith said in a press release. \u201cThis is what we deliver through our distinctive, data-centric compliance platform.\u201d\n\nRegtech rush\n\nThere has been a flurry of activity across the regtech space of late, with news recently emerging that publicly-traded regulatory compliance company Computer Services, Inc. (CSI) is set to be acquired by a duo of private equity firms for $1.6 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
