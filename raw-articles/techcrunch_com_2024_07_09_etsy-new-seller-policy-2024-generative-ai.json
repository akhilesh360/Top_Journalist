The service revised its seller policy on Tuesday, introducing new labels that clarify whether a seller made, designed, sourced or handpicked an item. This marks the first time it has dealt directly with artificial intelligence in its seller policy, with the addition of clear guidelines around what the site does and doesn\u2019t accept.\n\nEtsy explained that the new set of \u201cCreativity Standards\u201d requires sellers to classify the more than 100 million items on the platform with clear labels that state the level of \u201chuman involvement\u201d that went into the product. The new labels are located under the \u201cItem Details\u201d section in the description.\n\nFor example, if a store owner sells vintage goods, those items would be marked as \u201cHandpicked.\u201d Craft and party supplies should be labeled as \u201cSourced.\u201d The \u201cHandmade\u201d label, meanwhile, refers to physical products made by the seller themselves or with tools like a 3D printer or Cricut machine.\n\nThe new \u201cDesigned\u201d label is likely a response to the increasing presence of AI-generated items that have taken over the once handmade marketplace. Etsy has received considerable backlash in recent years for accepting AI art, due to its impact on more traditional artists. AI tools are capable of mimicking artists\u2019 styles to generate artwork. Despite ethical concerns, the service is embracing this technology.\n\nAs the company explains in its Seller Handbook, sellers can \u201cuse their original prompts in combination with AI tools to create the artwork they sell on Etsy.\u201d Sellers must label their item as \u201cDesigned by,\u201d which tells buyers that what they\u2019re purchasing might be designed with generative AI, an outside production partner or other digital tools.\n\n\u201cPermitted examples of this might include a fantasy scene based on a seller\u2019s original prompt or inputs and produced by an AI generator, or a custom portrait of a buyer\u2019s pet generated using AI tools,\u201d the company added. \u201cSellers must disclose within their listing description if an item is created with the use of AI.\u201d\n\nWhile sellers are permitted to design items using AI tools, which Etsy calls \u201cSeller-prompted AI creations,\u201d Etsy has added a new rule whereby they aren\u2019t allowed to sell AI prompts. You\u2019ve likely seen these types of listings flood the platform, such as \u201c10,000 Midjourney Prompts,\u201d \u201cUltimate ChatGPT Prompts Pack\u201d and so on. A spokesperson told TechCrunch that these listings would be flagged and removed from Etsy starting today.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

According to Silverman, Etsy removed four times the number of listings that violated its Handmade policy compared to the previous year."}
