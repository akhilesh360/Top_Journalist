It plans to use this Series B to continue working toward building a \u201cfault tolerant\u201d quantum computer (accepting errors and working around them) based on cat qubits. Alice & Bob believes its first \u201cuseful\u201d quantum computer will be available by 2030.\n\n\u201cFrom the get go, Alice & Bob had a very clear vision of how quantum computers should be made [and] it was all about fault tolerance,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Th\u00e9au Peronnin in an interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the whole industry over the last 12 to 18 months is really a complete shift to align with our vision.\u201d\n\nThe appetite for more computing power is at the highest it has ever been \u2014 a belief underscored by major projects like the $500 billion Stargate AI data center commitment in the U.S., and the huge boost that computing chip makers like Nvidia have seen in recent times.\n\nAs Peronnin sees it, the traditional computing architecture race is untenable in the longer run, and that will drive more investment in quantum computing as it promises more efficiency than traditional processors.\n\n\u201cComputing is becoming the core resource for productivity, and quantum is a potential game changer here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game is on.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

While the startup is not disclosing its valuation, for some guidance, Riverlane (a partner of Alice & Bob\u2019s) was valued last year at around $400 million. We understand from multiple sources that Alice & Bob is at a comparable valuation, more likely between $300 million and $400 million.\n\nThe deal represents one of the larger rounds for a quantum computing startup in Europe. But notably for the quantum industry, it\u2019s not happening in a vacuum.\n\nSome of the more notable fundraises in the space include Riverlane, which also builds technology to correct quantum errors, raising $75 million; quantum chip maker SEEQC, which raised $30 million earlier this month; and Quantum Machines, which is reportedly also in the process of raising $100 million. Perhaps the biggest of all, last year, Quantinuum raised $300 million at a $5 billion valuation. There is now talk of it listing at a $10 billion valuation.\n\nMeanwhile, Google had a breakthrough in the fault-removal race in November 2024 with AlphaQubit, an AI system that it said could automatically identify errors in quantum computations. And, Microsoft and Atom Computing promised they would release a commercial quantum computer sometime this year.\n\nThe startup\u2019s name and the cat qubit are both key to what it is building. \u201cAlice & Bob\u201d is a reference to the two fictional characters that are often used as archetypes for hypothetical thought experiments in areas like cryptography and quantum physics.\n\nThe building block of Alice & Bob\u2019s system also has a theoretical reference in it. Rather than pursuing ways to reduce faults by throwing more qubits at the problem (qubits are the typical building blocks of a quantum computing system), Alice & Bob devised an architecture that it calls a \u201ccat qubit.\u201d This is a reference to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat and the idea of something being in \u201ctwo states\u201d at once. Effectively, it accepts some faults (hence \u201cfault tolerant\u201d) while fixing others.\n\nAs Peronnin describes it, \u201ccat qubit is a special design of qubit that is meant to correct errors directly at the hardware level \u2014 not all of them, half of them, to be precise \u2014 but that is really the result of the cat qubit. It\u2019s to have this first layer of built-in error correction. And the reason why we went for that is because we believed it would dramatically simplify the total machine.\u201d\n\nAlice & Bob\u2019s investors believe this could be the key to making quantum a commercial reality.\n\n\u201cReality is at the core of our debate about quantum in the investment industry,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Robinet, a partner at AVP, said in an interview. He said that while he has been watching Alice & Bob for years, AVP hadn\u2019t wanted to invest before \u201cbecause it was just R&D\u201d like so many others. But now, he said, with quantum chip architecture appearing to be capable of supporting 48 qubits, \u201cwe believe the R&D phase is over.\u201d\n\nFran\u00e7ois Charbonnier, a partner at Bpifrance, seconds this. \u201cGetting rid one of two major errors,\u201d as Alice & Bob is doing, is the game changer for scaling, he said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s still a long-term marathon, but we are convinced that Alice & Bob will be in the race.\u201d"}
