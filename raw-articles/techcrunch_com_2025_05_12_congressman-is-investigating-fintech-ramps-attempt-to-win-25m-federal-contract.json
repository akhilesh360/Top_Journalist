Gerald Connolly, ranking member of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, has initiated an investigation into whether expense management startup Ramp is receiving preferential treatment in its bid for a $25 million government contract.\n\nConnolly sent a letter to General Services Administration (GSA) Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian demanding information and documents related to the GSA\u2019s reported plans to award a contract for a pilot program to Ramp. News of the probe was first reported by ProPublica.\n\nAmong Connolly\u2019s biggest concerns are that Ramp allegedly has \u201czero federal contracting experience\u201d and its investors include a number of Trump allies and supporters. Those investors include Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital (founded by Josh Kushner, brother of Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared), vocal Trump supporter 8VC\u2019s Joe Lonsdale, and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and brother of former Republican President George W. Bush. Rabois, according to Connolly\u2019s letter, raised more than $1 million for Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign.\n\nConnolly is requesting several things from the GSA, including a detailed list of all meetings between any GSA official and any Ramp representative, and all communications between any GSA official, contractor, or subcontractor and any Ramp representative.\n\nThe government\u2019s internal expense card program, dubbed SmartPay, is a $700 billion program. Currently, Citibank and US Bank, two of the nation\u2019s largest suppliers of credit cards, are the official banks of the current SmartPay contract.\n\nIn April, Ramp\u2019s head of communications, Lindsay McKinley, confirmed to TechCrunch that the startup was \u201ccompeting in a standard procurement process for a SmartPay pilot program based on the strength of our solution.\u201d\n\nShe claimed that the startup Ramp saw a public post on X shared by the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, on February 18 that said \u201cthe US government currently has ~4.6M active credit cards/accounts, which processed ~90M unique transactions for ~$40B of spend in FY24.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Since its inception in 2019, the startup has raised over $1 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding."}
