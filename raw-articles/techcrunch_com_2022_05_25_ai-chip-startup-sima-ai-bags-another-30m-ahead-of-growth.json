A recent ZDNet piece reaffirms that the AI edge chip market is booming, fueled by \u201cstaggering\u201d venture capital financing in the hundreds of millions of dollars. EdgeQ, Kneron and Hailo are among the dozens of upstarts vying for customers, the last of which nabbed $136 million in October as it doubles down on new opportunities.\n\nAnother company competing in the increasingly saturated segment is SiMa.ai, which is developing a system-on-chip platform for AI applications \u2014 particularly computer vision applications. After emerging from stealth in 2019, SiMa.ai began demoing an accelerator chipset that combines \u201ctraditional compute IP\u201d from Arm with a custom machine learning accelerator and dedicated vision accelerator, linked via a proprietary interconnect,\n\nTo lay the groundwork for future growth, SiMa.ai today closed a $30 million additional investment from Fidelity Management & Research Company, with participation from Lip-Bu Tan (who\u2019s joining the board) and previous investors, concluding the startup\u2019s Series B. It brings SiMa.ai\u2019s total capital raised to $150 million.\n\n\u201cThe funding will be used to accelerate scaling of the engineering and business teams globally, and to continue investing in both hardware and software innovation,\u201d founder and CEO Krishna Rangasayee told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThe appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as the newest member of SiMa.ai\u2019s board of directors is a strategic milestone for the company. He has a deep history of investing in deep tech startups that have gone on to disrupt industries across AI, data, semiconductors, among others.\u201d\n\nRangasayee spent most of his career in the semiconductor industry at Xilinx, where he was GM of the company\u2019s overall business. An engineer by trade \u2014 Rangasayee was the COO at Groq and once headed product planning at Altera, which Intel acquired in 2015 \u2014 he says that he was motivated to start SiMa.ai by the gap he saw in the machine learning market for edge devices.\n\n\u201cI founded SiMa.ai with two questions: \u2018What are the biggest challenges in scaling machine learning to the embedded edge?\u2019 and \u2018How can we help?\u2019,\u201d Rangasaye said. \u201cBy listening to dozens of industry-leading customers in the machine learning trenches, SiMa.ai developed a deep understanding of their problems and needs \u2014 like getting the benefits of machine learning without a steep learning curve, preserving legacy applications along with future proof ML implementations, and working with a high-performance, low-power solution in a user-friendly environment.\u201d\n\nSiMa.ai aims to work with companies developing driverless cars, robots, medical devices, drones and more. The company claims to have completed several customer engagements and last year announced the opening of a design center in Bengaluru, India, as well as a collaboration with the University of T\u00fcbingen to identify AI hardware and software solutions for \u201cultra-low\u201d energy consumption.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Even though these applications will use many diverse computer vision pipelines with a variety of machine learning models, SiMa.ai\u2019s software and hardware platform has the flexibility to be used to address these,\u201d Rangasayee added. \u201cSiMa.ai\u2019s platform addresses any computer vision application using any model, any framework, any sensor, any resolution \u2026 [We as a company have] seized the opportunity to disrupt the burgeoning edge computing space in pursuit of displacing decades-old technology and legacy incumbents.\u201d\n\nSiMa.ai\u2019s challenges remain mass manufacturing its chips affordably \u2014 and beating back the many rivals in the edge AI computing space. (The companys says that it plans to ship \u201cmass-produced production volumes\u201d of its first chip \u201csometime this year.\u201d) But the startup stands to profit handsomely if it can capture even a sliver of the sector. Edge computing is forecast to be a $6.72 billion market by 2022, according to Markets and Markets. Its growth will coincide with that of the deep learning chipset market, which some analysts predict will reach $66.3 billion by 2025.\n\n\u201cMachine learning has had a profound impact on the cloud and mobile markets over the past decade and the next battleground is the multi-trillion-dollar embedded edge market,\u201d Tan said in a statement. \u201cSiMa.ai has created a software-centric, purpose-built \u2026 platform that exclusively targets this large market opportunity. SiMa.ai\u2019s unique architecture, market understanding and world-class team has put them in a leadership position.\u201d"}
