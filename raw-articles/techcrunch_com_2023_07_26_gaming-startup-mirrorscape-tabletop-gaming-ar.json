A PC version is launching in the coming months.\n\nSimilar to other companies in the same space (Ardent Roleplay, Spatial and Tilt Five), Mirrorscape\u2019s most significant feature is its building capabilities. The customizable platform provides game masters (GMs) with a toolset for creating an animated world of their dark and twisted dreams, from dimly lit dungeons to small villages overrun by orcs.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Individual digital items, such as miniature figures and terrain, range from 99 cents to $4.99.\n\nThe app includes a free starter kit, including approximately a dozen or so free maps, a few basic structures like cavern walls, cobblestone floors and doorways, along with five free minis, including a dwarf, a barbarian and a huntress. Hero Forge users can link their digital mini for free.\n\nIn addition to Hero Forge, the company partners with major game publishers and model manufacturers Paizo (Pathfinder and Starfinder), Reaper, Fat Dragon, Dwarven Forge and many others.\n\nMirrorscape offers two types of playing modes. Players can either view the map in AR mode \u2014 where they point and look through their phone cameras to explore the landscape \u2014 or 3D mode, which takes place in virtual rooms such as \u201cForge\u2019s Tavern,\u201d featuring a cozy fireplace and mugs of mead, and \u201cThe Hall of Heroes,\u201d a candlelit room that pays tribute to fallen adventurers.\n\nThere are only two virtual rooms available at launch, but the company plans to launch more in the near future, Eric McIntire, the company\u2019s brand manager, told TechCrunch.\n\nBoth versions come with POV mode, where party members can click on an eye icon to look at the world from their characters\u2019 perspective.\n\nAfter testing the app, we found that 3D mode was the most difficult to navigate, especially when zooming in and out or trying to look at the map from a different angle. It\u2019s recommended that users turn off \u201cCenter Pivot\u201d in the top-right menu to avoid a frustrating experience.\n\nThe AR mode is the most ideal for more interactive experiences. For instance, if a dungeon master wants to create an engaging atmosphere to pair with augmented reality, they can tell their players to go outside and turn on POV mode so it feels like they\u2019re walking through an actual cavern. (Similar to Pok\u00e9mon GO, where players can look through their cameras and discover a Roselia in their very own garden.)\n\n\u201cImagine all the players actually meet up in person and go outside,\u201d McIntire said, painting one possible scenario. \u201c[The GM] can watch from inside as they walk around his dungeon, and he narrates in their headsets, \u2018You start to smell burning sulfur, death and decay.\u2019 And they walk around the corner and see zombies that he\u2019s got moving towards them.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting tool that GMs may appreciate is the ability to conceal certain spaces on the map. For instance, if they want to hide a room where a monster is waiting for its moment to strike, the GM can tap on an area and watch it disappear. Co-founder and COO Donald Bland mentioned to us that, eventually, users would be able to scan a physical, handwritten map with their camera, which would then upload as a 3D version on Mirrorscape.\n\nOther features include a journal option to keep track of dice rolls and a messaging feature. The company is working on bringing effects to the app, such as lightning bolts for when a sorcerer casts a spell.\n\nHowever, Mirrorscape lacks one important element. The app currently doesn\u2019t offer a character sheet feature for D&D players to refer back to their ability scores, proficiencies, equipment and so forth. Many players use their phones or desktops to look at their sheets, so to have to constantly switch tabs would probably take them out of the immersive experience that Mirrorscape is designed for.\n\nMcIntire mentioned that a character sheet option is a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\n\nFor now, iOS device users can mirror share their screen to a compatible smart TV or Mac and use a separate device to view the character sheet. Android devices can also mirror their screen to the TV. Players using an iPad can opt for the multitasking feature, but this option might be distracting as the separate tab would partially block the screen.\n\nMirrorscape isn\u2019t solely designed for private game sessions; it\u2019s a tool for Twitch streamers as well. Soon, content creators will be able to share a QR code with viewers for them to scan, download the app and be immersed in the same digital world as their favorite streamers.\n\n\u201cWhen [viewers] look at their living room tables, the pieces are moving digitally on their living room table as the players are moving them physically. So, you could actually experience that 3D physical build as though it\u2019s happening in front of you,\u201d McIntire explained.\n\nMcIntire loosely calls this \u201cpresentation mode,\u201d which can have thousands of people join a single session, in turn helping creators boost their engagement and following.\n\nFor reference, the Mirrorscape team played a test session on Twitch, which can be viewed on YouTube.\n\nThe company was co-founded in 2020 by Grant Anderson (CEO) and Donald Bland (COO), veteran D&D players who met while working at Sony. The duo has an extensive background in technology and entertainment, particularly virtual reality and 3D production.\n\n\u201cAugmented reality was just starting to emerge and was perfect for tabletop gaming,\u201d Anderson told us, who first came up with the idea for Mirrorscape. \u201cI wanted to create something that really gives you that feeling of playing with your friends, and AR was the technology that could do that,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, \u201cTrue Blood\u201d actor and hardcore D&D nerd Joe Manganiello is Mirrorscape\u2019s creative director.\n\n\u201cI am both excited and invigorated to be a part of the Mirrorscape team,\u201d Manganiello said in a statement. \u201cThrough their technology, I have seen the future of gaming and entertainment, and I am incredibly passionate about getting it into the hands of the public. It is going to blow minds and change everything!\u201d\n\nMirrorscape appeared on Kickstarter in 2022 and raised nearly $500,000. The company also had a $2 million seed round led by TenOneTen Ventures and Ethos Fund.\n\nIt has since grown to about 7,000 beta users, the company said.\n\nThe company is in the process of developing Mirrorscape for compatibility with AR glasses and headsets, so gamers can play around with hand and eye tracking, further enhancing high-tech TTRPG sessions. For example, Mirrorscape leverages Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 Snapdragon Spaces program, which enables smart glass wearers to automatically detect tabletop surfaces and manipulate game pieces. The company also notes that its platform is running on Lenovo\u2019s AR glasses prototype.\n\nThe company hopes to make the platform available on VR headsets in the near future.\n\nAlthough virtual tabletop games will never truly replace traditional TTRPGs, there\u2019s potential for them to become a trend as AR and VR technology continue to evolve. On top of that, GMs curious about the high-tech side of TTRPG play might love not having to hand-draw maps and painstakingly paint their own minis.\n\nUpdated 7/26/23 at 11:05 a.m. ET with the correction that Wizards of the Coast is not a Mirrorscape partner."}
