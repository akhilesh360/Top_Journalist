TechCrunch understands the all-stock deal is valued at $125 million \u2014 just one-third of the $380 million that the startup had raised from investors over the years (a figure sources dispute, see below), and likely a fraction of its peak valuation.\n\nMetropolis\u2019s tech is used in 4,000 locations, and the company says it processes some $5 billion in payments annually. And $5 billion is an important number. We understand that Metropolis is now in the process of fundraising at a valuation that is approaching $5 billion. Oosto investors \u2014 which include SoftBank, FifthWall, Lightspeed, DFJ, Eldridge Industries, and others \u2014 receive Series D preferred stock in as part of the Oosto transaction. The acquisition includes Oosto\u2019s IP and team, and CEO Avi Golan and CTO Dieter Joecker will take senior roles at Metropolis.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed the details over the phone and in a statement: \u201cMetropolis, an artificial intelligence company whose computer vision platform enables checkout-free payment experiences for the real world, has agreed to acquire Oosto, the leading AI safety and security company.\u201d Metropolis will be folding in some of Oosto\u2019s technology to enhance its current business, she added.\n\nLast week, Globes broke the news that Oosto was up for sale.\n\nThe sale caps off a turbulent several years for Oosto.\n\nAs AnyVision, the company was one of a wave of computer vision startups building technology being used in controversial surveillance applications. Over the years, there were reports exposing which organizations were quietly using its technology and how the Israeli government tapped it to spy on Palestinians; other reports shed light on just how much data the company was able to collect.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In 2020, it appointed a new CEO, Avi Golan, who had worked at SoftBank, and then in 2021, AnyVision, pitching itself as an ethical AI company, raised a whopping $235 million in a round led by SoftBank and Eldridge. Other backers of the company have included Lightspeed and Qualcomm, per PitchBook data.\n\nJust months after the big SoftBank raise, AnyVision rebranded to Oosto and looked to pivot to more enterprise applications as it inked a research partnership with Carnegie Mellon. But it seems that the difficulties continued, with rounds of layoffs and Oosto parting ways with the university.\n\nWe understand from sources close to the company that Oosto was making around $20 million in annual revenues and was signing new deals up to the acquisition.\n\nIt\u2019s worth wondering whether some of Oosto\u2019s problems might have been a matter of timing. The last couple of years have seen big geopolitical shifts, AI has entered the mainstream of public consciousness, and a new wave of AI companies like Anduril and Helsing seem to be breaking many taboos on building military, defense, and (more euphemistically) \u201cresilience\u201d technology.\n\nWould AnyVision (or Oosto) have appeared as controversial today as it did five years ago? Regardless, the rise and fall of Oosto can be seen as a memento mori for the newer wave of AI companies being funded today on very high hopes, but perhaps not very high revenues (let alone profits).\n\nThat brings us to Metropolis. It, too, is focused on computer vision, but \u201cfocus\u201d is perhaps the operative word here: Its square aim is to build AI-based systems for parking environments, automatically tracking cars when they enter or leave a space, and charging accordingly. In 2023, Metropolis raised $1.7 billion in financing and other investment, most of which was used to buy another parking technology specialist called SP Plus for $1.5 billion.\n\nFrom what we understand, the basic plan now will be to use Oosto tech to enhance Metropolis\u2019s capabilities around computer vision in parking environments, rather than to expand to covering a number of other use cases. Over time, it could include more applications where customers regularly drive or walk in and out of a business environment (e.g., drive-throughs).\n\n\u201cTech-wise this acquisition makes the perfect sense,\u201d Avihai Michaeli, an investment banking adviser based in Tel Aviv, told TechCrunch. \u201cBoth Metropolis and Oosto (formerly known as AnyVision Tech) are key players in the AI-driven computer vision and security solutions space, with applications that enhance urban management, public safety, and automation. Both companies focus on leveraging cutting-edge technology to create safer, smarter, and more efficient environments through artificial intelligence and data analytics.\u201d\n\nHe added that the current war in Israel has made it challenging for some Israeli companies looking to raise money or do other business, which could have also played a role here.\n\nUpdate: a source close to Oosto claims that the company had only ever raised around $160 million. The large SoftBank investment of $235 million in 2021 was delivered in tranches, the source said, with only $60 million deposited at the time of the deal. By the time the second tranche was due, SoftBank\u2019s VisionFund itself was pulling back on its activities and Oosto was in restructuring mode, so nothing further ever came through. All public records still describe Oosto\u2019s funding as between $350 million and $380 million (per PitchBook)."}
