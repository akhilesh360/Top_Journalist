In Northern Ireland, it\u2019s at 18%,\u201d said Derek Roddy, co-founder and CEO of smart home company Climote. \u201cIf you\u2019re a wind farmer, you are feeling the pain. This is a huge chunk of change that you\u2019re walking away from, but the system struggles with what to do with it.\u201d\n\nRoddy had been mulling this problem over for a while. Climote focuses on heating and hot water, so he thinks a lot about supply and demand signals in the electricity sector. It was on his mind when he attended an event where an Irish social enterprise called FoodCloud took home one of the top awards. FoodCloud, which was founded in 2012 by two university students, intercepts food that would otherwise go to waste and donates it to those in need.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just listening in the audience to their whole story about sustainability, and I went, shit, surplus energy, surplus food \u2014 they\u2019re the same,\u201d Roddy told TechCrunch+.\n\nAt that moment, he realized that he had been approaching the surplus energy problem the wrong way. With his company, he had been focused on the technology part of the puzzle. While that\u2019s still a key piece, it hadn\u2019t made the dent he wanted. After all, Ireland was still wasting a significant amount of wind power.\n\n\u201cI went, OK, maybe we\u2019re looking at this wrong, Maybe we need to go and do our bit for the world and the globe in solving the surplus piece and by default we prove how the actual system could work.\u201d The answer wouldn\u2019t be another startup, but a nonprofit social enterprise styled after FoodCloud.\n\nFinding partners\n\nHaving spent the last two decades in the smart home business, Roddy had a front-row seat to the Celtic Tiger economy. The tech sector had helped pull the previously agricultural nation out of poverty and turned it into one of the wealthiest nations in Europe. But even in wealthy countries, some people tend to be left behind.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Last year, 5.3% of the country\u2019s population was living in consistent poverty and another 13.1% was at risk of poverty. Given that the country has some of the highest electricity costs in the EU, energy can make up a significant portion of an impoverished household\u2019s expenses.\n\nInspired by the FoodCloud story, Roddy wanted to help people who had trouble paying their utility bills. He and Cathal Lee, a managing partner at Instinctif Partners, approached the CEO of Wind Energy Ireland, a trade group that represents wind farmers. \u201cBy any chance, would your members be willing to give their surplus to people in fuel poverty?\u201d Roddy asked him. In principle, the wind association\u2019s members were supportive. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to get dumped, and there\u2019s no other solutions, they\u2019d be willing to do it,\u201d Roddy recalled of their response.\n\nOffer in hand, he then went to an executive at Cluid, one of the largest housing nonprofits in Ireland, which was more than happy to accept. \u201cThe following week, three of us met in a hotel in Dublin, and I said, \u2018You\u2019ve got wind, you\u2019ve got 10,000 homes. Could we actually make this work?\u2019\u201d Roddy asked. Soon after, they went to the grid operator, EirGrid, which was also keen on pitching in. The nonprofit was starting to take shape, and soon it had a name: EnergyCloud.\n\nForging bonds\n\nNot too long after the initial meetings, the world went into lockdown as COVID-19 swept the globe. Rather than put things on hold, the group, now consisting of Roddy along with senior executives from WEI, Cluid, flipped open their laptops or hopped on the phone and met weekly. \u201cThe ask was fairly onerous: Could we do an hour every Friday?\u201d Roddy recalled. \u201cIt took about 12 months for everyone to get to know each other.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s composition \u2014 the organizations\u2019 core operational leaders \u2014 and its commitment to meeting regularly was key, he said. They also asked Iseult Ward, co-founder and CEO of FoodCloud, to join a few meetings to help guide them through the process. \u201cThat was the acorn, the seed, the first green shoots coming out of the ground,\u201d Roddy said.\n\nTo ensure supply and demand were balanced and more evenly distributed, the first device EnergyCloud installed in Cluid-managed homes was a smart switch for water heaters. In many homes in Ireland, water heaters don\u2019t maintain a fixed set point 24-7 like they do in the U.S. Rather, they\u2019re manually controlled or timed to switch on when electricity is cheapest, which is usually at night. When EnergyCloud knows that there will be a wind curtailment, it sends a text message telling people not to switch on their water heaters. Then, in the morning, they get another, alerting them that they received a free tank of hot water overnight.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got three kids to wash, and you don\u2019t have any money, you\u2019re going, \u2018That is cool,\u2019\u201d Roddy said. For now, the grid operator doesn\u2019t charge for transmission, though that may change in the future. Roddy has suggested that the grid might charge EnergyCloud a special rate and then donate the funds back to nonprofit.\n\nIn the process, EnergyCloud is helping to test a possible future for the grid. Renewable power like wind and solar doesn\u2019t always line up with the ebbs and flows of demand. Batteries are one way to smooth the curves, but shifting demand is another. Smart devices that coordinate with the wider grid won\u2019t work for every use, but for things like water heaters or EV chargers, they could help soak up excess power that would otherwise be curtailed. That\u2019s been the dream of the smart grid proponents for well over a decade, though it\u2019s one that hasn\u2019t really taken off. Roddy thinks EnergyCloud could help prove the model; all the relevant players are on board, and Ireland\u2019s grid is relatively small. \u201cAll we really need is to get equipment in the home, model what it would look like when there\u2019s surplus, switch on the device, and prove that it works.\u201d\n\nToday, EnergyCloud is providing free energy in Ireland, and it\u2019s setting up operations in Northern Ireland. England and Wales are next, and Roddy is hoping to expand to the U.S. in the next 12 to 18 months. That\u2019s an impressive timeline for an organization that still doesn\u2019t have a bank account.\n\nThat\u2019ll have to change soon, but the organization\u2019s finances, or lack thereof, are revealing. Where most organizations and startups would begin by raising money, EnergyCloud has taken a completely different tack, approaching key executives first and asking them to join an organization that they\u2019ll help shape. \u201cThey need to join the board or be part of the organization to make it work,\u201d Roddy said.\n\n\u201cOnce they\u2019re part of the organization and everyone\u2019s sitting around a table, it\u2019s like everything in human nature. Once that trust gets built up, anything\u2019s possible.\u201d"}
