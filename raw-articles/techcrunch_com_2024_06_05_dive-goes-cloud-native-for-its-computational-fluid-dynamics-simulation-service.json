But that\u2019s exactly what Boston- and Berlin-based Dive is doing. The company aims to change how manufacturers use computer simulations by using both modern mathematical approaches and cloud computing to disrupt a market that is mostly dominated by a small number of incumbents.\n\nDive\u2019s customer list includes the likes of BMW, BSH, K\u00e4rcher, Siemens and ZF.\n\nImage Credits:Dive\n\nThe company, which on Wednesday announced that it has raised a $10 million Series A round led by D.E. Shaw Group, was spun out of German multinational Bosch in 2018. Dive co-founder and CEO Pierre Sabrowski tells me that he started working at Bosch during his PhD studies. His first few years were spent trying to simulate washing machines.\n\n\u201cThe washing machine seems like such a small thing, but there are, I think, 700 or 800 engineers these days \u2014 maybe even more \u2014 in Berlin, dedicatedly working on the washing machines of Bosch. So this is huge. It\u2019s a huge market, and we were part of simulating that. And we simply failed,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe techniques available at the time simply weren\u2019t good enough to simulate something as complex as fluids moving in a washing machine. But after a few years of trying, the team happened upon a technique used by astrophysicists that treats fluids as being made up of particles instead of as an interconnected mesh, like older techniques did.\n\nImage Credits:Dive\n\nThe team at Bosch started extending an open source tool to perform those mesh-free simulations for its own needs, all while working on the fundamental science behind it, too. \u201cThe team around that group is pretty big and in 2017, our department lead said: \u2018Hey, OK, the team is too big. We can\u2019t afford that anymore in Bosch alone. The number of applications is also limited to what we can do at Bosch, so maybe you guys should start as a spin-off.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt first, the team was mostly doing projects for clients because, as Sabrowski told me, the software itself wasn\u2019t at a point where anybody outside of Dive could really use it yet. By 2021, though, Dive started selling licenses and then raised its seed round, even before it had a real 3D user interface to visualize the results.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In that respect, washing machines and gear boxes aren\u2019t all that different. The company also still targets household appliance manufacturers, as well as companies building dispensing systems.\n\nOffering a better simulation is definitely an incentive for Dive\u2019s customers, but Sabrowski also stressed that the team spent a lot of time on how it wants to deliver its solution. In the end, Dive decided to go with a cloud-enabled solution, where the interface lives on the desktop.\n\nDive\u2019s Series A round was led by D.E. Shaw, with First Momentum Ventures, Segenia Capital and Senovo Capital participating in Dive\u2019s seed round. The company plans to use the new funding to expand its simulation portfolio to cover a wider range of use cases and strengthen its data analytics and data governance programs. Dive\u2019s customers are already storing their engineering data in Dive\u2019s cloud platform, after all, so helping them best analyze and leverage that data is an obvious next step.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about Dive\u2019s potential to transform the manufacturing and computer-aided engineering industries,\u201d said Jean Nations of the D. E. Shaw Group. \u201cDive\u2019s mesh-free and cloud-native approach is designed to enable engineers to create simulations that reduce industrial production timelines and costs, leading to greater efficiency in the engineering process.\u201d"}
