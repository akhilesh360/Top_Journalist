These numbers are apparently based on current policies, and if more resources go toward the clean energy transition, the report\u2019s authors expect the number to rise, too. But the creation of more jobs doesn\u2019t mean there will be enough trained folks to fill them.\n\nBerlin-based Montamo wants to solve this problem. The startup hires and trains folks to install and maintain sustainable heat pumps. It trains people new to the trades, provides upskilling training to those who have some experience, and has its workers install and maintain equipment for other companies. The company hopes to expand into other areas, like solar power, as it grows.\n\nMontamo wants to have a positive social impact as well, co-founder Alexander Boehm told TechCrunch+. Boehm said the company wants to be intentional about hiring and training migrant workers, as it can be hard for migrants to get a good job in Germany regardless of their skills or background. That\u2019s something Boehm witnessed firsthand when he was working as a director of operations for quick-grocery delivery startup Gorillas, and he doesn\u2019t want their skills to go to waste.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of talent that\u2019s coming to Germany; [they] have a migration background, they are super willing to work,\u201d Boehm said, recalling his time hiring migrant workers at Gorillas. \u201cThey have drive and passion. They might have done a ton of work in the trades in their home countries, and we are leveraging these people for delivering our groceries in 10 minutes. I [thought] we could leverage them in a whole new way.\u201d\n\nThe company was only founded this November and has already raised a \u20ac2.1 million pre-seed round, led by Project A Ventures, with participation from several angel investors. The startup is also building a tech stack that will help train its workers so they can franchise or strike out on their own in the future, co-founder Ole Schaumberg said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For one, its focus on migrant workers is a great way to do some good while working to solve the clean tech labor shortage. Giving folks an opportunity to learn a skill that is in demand is a great way to help put people on a career path with more potential upside.\n\nPlus, these industries need a lot of trained workers. The lack of people trained in this sector is a global pain point \u2014 here in the U.S., we\u2019ve seen numerous state and federal initiatives try to solve this gap. Last year\u2019s federal infrastructure bill earmarked $72 million for business and trade schools to help upskill workers for clean tech jobs. And back in 2019, New York set aside more than $170 million to upskill workers in the state for these jobs.\n\n\u201cIf no one is tackling the shortage of labor and skilled labor in climate trades, we definitely won\u2019t reach any of our goals,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cWe believe that there is a big market and money to be made, but even better, we can make a positive impact on our world and our planet. That\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nWe know of at least one other startup trying to solve the clean tech labor shortage. ChargerHelp! is a Los Angeles\u2013based startup that trains and employs folks to install and maintain electric vehicle chargers. As the clean tech industry continues to grow, hopefully we\u2019ll see more.\n\nMontamo\u2019s a bit similar to the startup we talked about last week, Nth Cycle. The latter is working to make it easier and more efficient to refine and recycle rare metals and is helping build the infrastructure the clean tech industry needs to maximize its impact. Montamo is no different.\n\nThe clean energy transition can\u2019t happen without a trained workforce, and Montamo can help build one."}
