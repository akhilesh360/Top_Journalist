The initiative is called tactically responsive space, or TacRS, and it\u2019s already resulted in record-breaking missions: Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Alpha rocket left the pad just 27 hours after it received its launch notice from the Space Force under its TacRS contract last year.\n\nWhile Gravitics was unable to provide more details as to the exact concept of operations, startup co-founder and CMO Mike DeRosa did clarify in an email that the company is not putting a module on a rocket for a tactically responsive launch. Instead, the mission is related to developing \u201cplatforms to enable a new kind of tactically responsive space mission,\u201d he said.\n\nThe $1.7 million contract was awarded by SpaceWERX in partnership with Space Systems Command\u2019s Space Safari Program Office. In a statement, Space Safari\u2019s director of operations Lt Col Jason Altenhofen, said Gravitics\u2019 module \u201coffers an unconventional and potentially game-changing solution for TacRS.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we look into the future, the innovative use of commercial technologies will be an important aspect to solving some of our toughest challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

While there are scant concrete details about how the firms will work together, the company said the partners will \u201cassist in refining mission architecture, developing use-case specific outfitting, and developing flight hardware.\u201d\n\nRocket Lab and True Anomaly were awarded separate responsive space contracts for a mission called Victus Haze earlier this month. Under that contract, each company will build spacecraft that will then be rapidly commissioned and readied for rendezvous operations in orbit."}
