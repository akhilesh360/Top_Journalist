The new \u201c\u2018RV\u201d plan comes with some noteworthy differences versus its standard service \u2014 including the ability to stop and start service whenever you want.\n\nStarlink for RVs uses the same hardware as the standard offering, but automatically bundles in access wherever Starlink offers service, though SpaceX says that service quality may differ depending on whether you\u2019re in a coverage area marked \u201cAvailable\u201d (higher speeds and lower latency) or \u201cWaitlist\u201d (slower speeds and higher latency during peak usage hours).\n\nNote that this isn\u2019t designed to be used by RVs in motion; it\u2019s intended for use while you\u2019re stationary at parking spots, camping grounds and RV parks during your trip.\n\nStarlink RV costs $25 per month more than standard consumer service, meaning it\u2019s $135 per month, plus the cost of hardware. If you\u2019re paying close attention to Starlink pricing, you might notice that\u2019s the same cost as ordinary service plus the \u201cPortability\u201d feature Starlink introduced in March that allows you to take your dish anywhere else on the same continent where service is available and use it there.\n\nWhile Starlink for RVs is similar to basic Starlink + Portability, there are some key differences, including that there is no requirement to have a \u201chome\u201d address, and Starlink for RVs is available immediately without waitlist. The ability to pause and unpause service is also exclusive to the RV plan: Standard Starlink users aren\u2019t locked into any service duration beyond the rolling 30-day period that comes with a sub, but they aren\u2019t able to just stop and start service easily \u2014 doing so could put them to the back of the queue in an area with waitlisted demand.\n\nAlso, SpaceX crucially notes that RV customers are essentially considered second-tier by the service relative to standard home users. That doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to get a connection in a busy spot, but it might mean your connectivity isn\u2019t that great."}
