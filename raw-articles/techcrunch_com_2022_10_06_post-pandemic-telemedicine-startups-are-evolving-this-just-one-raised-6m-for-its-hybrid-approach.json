Healthcare is being gradually affected by data-driven insights gleaned through what the healthcare sector calls \u201cprecision medicine.\u201d The COVID-19 pandemic has added urgency to this sector. The 15-minute appointment that ends in prescription medicine is also being affected by the advance of remote telemedicine, and this whole arena is now being populated by startups.\n\nAlthough there is plenty of investment in telemedicine, there remains a space for using telemedicine in treating chronic diseases using a hybrid of in-home care and telemedicine. Other players in this space include CarbonHealth and Dispatch.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s of interest that telemedicine-based Index Health has now raised a $6 million seed round. The Miami-based startup says it offers \u201cdata-driven and personalized approach\u201d to a medical treatment called \u201croot cause\u201d or \u201cfunctional Medicine,\u201d using lab tests, specialized staff and personalization.\n\nThe $6 million round was co-led by LAUNCHub Ventures and Inovo Venture Partners and will be used to hire specialized medical professionals, engineering talent and expand across the U.S., employers, insurance companies and go direct to consumers.\n\nIndex Health\u2019s main focus is on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hormones and auto-immune conditions, where its members regularly speak to their physician and nutritionist. The startup says it collects over 1,000+ data points per single lab test and each session with a physician is an hour during the months-long course of treatment.\n\nThere are also specialized telemedicine providers such as Cerebral (mental health), Hinge (joints) and Virta (diabetes).\n\nThat said a string of healthcare unicorns have announced layoffs over the past few months, including Ro, Cerebral, Forward and Calibrate.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Index Health is hoping its data-driven, personalized approach, combined with telemedicine will be the more winning formula in \u201croot-cause medicine.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, CEO Luka Ivicevic \u2014 who previously co-founded a German challenger bank \u2014 said:\n\nWith Root Cause Medicine, we collect 1,000+ data-points using advanced lab tests, to make the most precise overview of why a disease is occurring in an individual\u2019s body. Based on this data, we make a treatment that\u2019s personalized for them and their condition.\n\nThe company is available in Florida, Virginia and New Hampshire."}
