Today, a startup from London called FloLive \u2014 which has built a platform to improve how those end users can use existing and new cellular connectivity more effectively \u2014 is announcing $47 million in funding, underscoring what it says has been a wave of demand for its services.\n\nFloLive\u2019s pitch is enterprise end users ideally like to manage their cellular connectivity needs in a single contact, but that has largely meant roaming deals for their carrier suppliers, which make up about 98% of the connectivity, estimated Nir Shalom, FloLive\u2019s CEO. The startup\u2019s tech essentially does away with that by managing the provisioning of IoT and other cellular data services regardless of where the end points are located, or what they are. It works across some 220 countries covering any and all kinds of cellular networks as available in each of them.\n\n\u201cIt can be water meters, or cars, or cameras or tracking devices,\u201d said Shalom in an interview. \u201cWhen you look at the market today the vast majority of solutions across more than one country is based on roaming services, or resellers.\u201d But in addition to resellers often being expensive, the other disadvantage, he said, is that they\u2019re more complex to deal with because of different data management regimes, such as GDPR, and \u201cthe performance is not as good. Roaming can have delays of 120 milliseconds or more, and companies for some services need much less.\u201d\n\nThe funding, a Series C, is being co-led by Greenfield Partners and 83North, with Qualcomm Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital, Saban Ventures and Hazelnut Partners participating.\n\nThe company previously had raised just over $41 million, primarily in the form of a $37 million round in 2021. That round included one tranche led by Intel, but notably the chip giant is no longer an investor in FloLive: Sharon said Intel Capital sold its stake about 20 months ago as part of a wider reassessment of its strategic priorities.\n\nThat is not the case for others. Alongside enterprises, FloLive\u2019s customers and partners include both carriers and the many companies that provide services to them. In that vein, Qualcomm is working with FloLive to power its own IoT platform, which it was built in part to target the opportunity of providing services to address the vast fragmentation in the world of cellular services when looking for coverage across more than one location.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Ericsson was using some of FloLive\u2019s tech in its own IoT business; then at the end of 2022 Ericsson announced it would be selling that business \u2014 which was loss-making \u2014 to Aeris.\n\nThe latter is a more direct competitor to FloLive, and Shalom confirmed that it\u2019s no longer working with the former Ericsson business, nor with Aeris itself. (But to add one more layer of complexity here: Qualcomm also backs Aeris\u2026) But in the fragmented world of telecoms technology, even this might spell opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe are now seeing increasing interest from old Ericsson customers, and we\u2019re now engaged with them,\u201d Shalom quipped.\n\nOther big partners for the company include the likes of cloud giants like AWS, which has been itself building out a business working increasingly with cellular carriers to provide both network management services, for example around 5G, and services for carriers to provide to their own enterprise customers. Shalom noted that there is a strong synergy between AWS and how FloLive is architected.\n\n\u201cWe have deepened our relationship with AWS,\u201d said Shalom. \u201cWe are all-cloud, and that allows them to use what we built. Cloud-native and cloud-centric is a part of what we do.\u201d\n\nThe company is not disclosing its valuation but we understand that it\u2019s flat on its last round. In 2021, it appears that figure was $108 million, according to Dealroom. That speaks to the challenges that still exist in the fundraising environment: You might be able to close your deals, but at what cost at the moment? And given that IoT remains a difficult business to eke out strong margins, that overall still means a lot of pressure on IoT businesses.\n\nStill, investors willing to make a bet for a longer-term outcome are coming.\n\n\u201cWe look for highly differentiated infrastructure technologies that can support a robust and modern technology stack on top of them,\u201d said Avery Schwartz, partner at Greenfield Partners, in a statement. \u201cAfter tracking the company and space for some time, floLIVE\u2019s rapid growth adds to our conviction that the company has developed a unique solution that elegantly solves for the full matrix of pain points traditionally plaguing the IoT connectivity market. This solution lays the foundation for new and innovative services that will dramatically change the IoT space as we know it; we are delighted to join floLIVE\u2019s promising journey.\u201d"}
