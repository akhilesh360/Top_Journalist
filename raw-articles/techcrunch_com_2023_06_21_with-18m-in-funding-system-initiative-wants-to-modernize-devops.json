System Initiative\u2018s co-founders believe that in order for DevOps to live up to its promises, it\u2019ll take a wholesale reimagining of what this toolchain looks like. At the core, System Initiative is tooling that lets DevOps teams build simulations of their infrastructure that then lets them quickly update their production environments. This new platform is now available in private beta and the company plans to open source many of its core tools.\n\nThe company today announced that it has raised a total of $18 million, including a $3 million seed round led by Amplify Partners, with participation from Storm Ventures and Battery Ventures, and a $15 million Series A round led by Scale Venture Partners, with participation from existing investors.\n\n\u201cThe DevOps pioneers aspired to bring world-class agility, reliability and security to everyone in the industry. Unfortunately, the current implementations leave most organizations stuck in the mediocre middle, a seemingly insurmountable distance from our shared aspirations,\u201d said Adam Jacob, CEO and co-founder of System Initiative. \u201cSystem Initiative was born from the recognition that we must be willing to rebuild DevOps from the ground up, rather than stitching together various tools across complex and lengthy pipelines, if we want to improve practitioners\u2019 lives and better the outcomes for the industry.\u201d\n\nAs Jacob stressed when I first talked to him earlier this year, a lot of enterprises hoped to mimic the fast release cycles of cloud-native companies by adopting DevOps. In reality, though, many struggle to deploy more than once a week. And while every tool in the pipeline has been optimized over and over again, the overall system has grown more complex and the overall user experience has seen little improvement.\n\n\u201cIf we want to keep the cultural improvements we\u2019ve gained and realize the full potential of what we can accomplish together, we need a second wave of DevOps tools,\u201d Jacob explained in System Initiative\u2019s launch post. \u201cA reinvigorated movement of builders, who are willing to explore what\u2019s possible when we are no longer constrained by the way the system worked in 2009. We can fix the user experience of doing DevOps work. We can re-imagine what it\u2019s like to collaborate on application deployment, infrastructure automation, and observability. Or we can continue to ossify around the status quo.\u201d\n\nUsing System Initiative\u2019s Figma-like multiuser visual interface, infrastructure engineers create digital twins to model their production systems and test their configurations. The tool will automatically generate the code to then put these configurations into production.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

I imagine how powerful this would be for complex chains of related resources \u2014 a ridiculous amount of configuration and pointless copy/paste work can be completely eliminated.\u201d"}
