There\u2019s a lot of churn,\u201d Rao, NeuBird\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that the modern IT stack just keeps getting more and more complex. Humans alone cannot possibly keep up with this kind of change.\u201d\n\nTo deal with that increased complexity, NeuBird built Hawkeye, an AI-powered SRE that can quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve issues, freeing human engineers for more strategic work.\n\nHaving raised a $22 million seed round from Mayfield in April (at a $100 million valuation, according to PitchBook data), NeuBird wasn\u2019t seeking additional funding. But when Microsoft\u2019s venture fund M12 reached out about an investment, NeuBird couldn\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019.\n\nSince many of NeuBird\u2019s customers run on Azure cloud, the partnership could help the company bring its solution to a larger market.\n\nOn Wednesday, NeuBird announced a $22.5 million seed extension round led by M12, with participation from Mayfield, Stepstone Group and Prosperity7 Ventures.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Rao said he chose to call the round \u201cseed-1\u201d precisely because NeuBird wants to raise larger funding from traditional Series A investors in the future, adding that the valuation for this round was \u201ca lot higher\u201d than the previous financing.\n\nJudging by investor interest, NeuBird is on to something.\n\nCompanies could \u201chire\u201d Hawkeye to look for active alerts and alarms in a continuous loop throughout the day. Once Hawkeye identifies an issue, it tries to troubleshoot it, but if it doesn\u2019t succeed, it escalates the incident to a human engineer.\n\nHawkeye works by using LLM reasoning to check logs of any system, including custom-built ones. \u201cLLMs have seen so many different application configuration scenarios that the fact that the LLM would run into an application log line message that it doesn\u2019t understand is minuscule,\u201d Rao said.\n\nHawkeye taps into all systems in a read-only mode, which means it doesn\u2019t store any of the customers\u2019 proprietary data. That\u2019s important for banks and other organizations that must safeguard personally identifiable information.\n\n\u201cHawkeye doesn\u2019t need to see the application itself or the application data. We don\u2019t need to see your transactional records,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we\u2019re looking at is the health data. Are there any alarms? Are there any errors in the logs? Is the CPU too high?\u201d\n\nThe company has already succeeded in landing customers ranging from large car manufacturing companies, financial institutions, pharmaceuticals, and even startups, with as few as 30 employees and only one IT operations engineer who is not able to keep up with incident tickets. While some of these organizations are still piloting the product, many have moved to production mode over the last couple of months.\n\nStill, while NeuBird has got VCs throwing money at it, with high valuations, at its seed round, it\u2019s not the only startup working on AI-powered SRE tasks. Y Combinator has supported three of them in 2024 alone (SRE.ai, Opslane, Parity) and a few others have launched as well like Cleric. And bigger players, like Moogsoft, also offer automated incident response features.\n\nStill, like sales automation and customer service automation, copilots, or teammates, as Mayfield\u2019s managing partner calls what NeuBird does, are coming for many developer and DevOps functions. And with this level of excitement from VCs, NueBird is one to watch.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: this story was modified to clarify that the company\u2019s previous seed-round valuation came from PitchBook."}
