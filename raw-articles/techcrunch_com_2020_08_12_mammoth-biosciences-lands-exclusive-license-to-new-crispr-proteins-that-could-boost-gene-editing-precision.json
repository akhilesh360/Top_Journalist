Obtained from UC Berkeley, the license covers R&D and commercialization across all potential fields. This is a significant addition to Mammoth\u2019s intellectual property holdings, as this new family of CRISPR proteins, known as the Cas\u0278 family, is roughly half the size of Cas9, the protein that effectively launched CRISPR to begin with.\n\nIn CRISPR, size actually matters quite a lot \u2014 the smaller size of Cas\u0278 could help this new protein family excel in areas including the exact precision of gene editing, as well as easing delivery for use in actual living cells and combining different target edits in a so-called \u201cmultiplex\u201d arrangement.\n\nIn July, a peer-reviewed paper published in Science detailed the discovery of Cas\u0278 and outlined its potential advantages for use in CRISPR gene editing. Cas\u0278 was discovered in bacteriophages, which is a type of virus that infects and replicates within bacteria \u2014 their literal translation is \u201cbacteria eater.\u201d\n\nIncreasing accuracy in CRISPR-based genetic editing has been an ongoing goal in the industry, with various approaches conceived and developed to help mitigate what is known as \u201coff-target\u201d activity, or unintended edits and genetic modifications that can occur when using the original Cas9-based editing approaches.\n\nMammoth Biosciences was founded by CRISPR co-discoverer Jennifer Doudna, and Douda\u2019s lab at UC Berkeley is the source of the new discovery. This definitely helps strengthen its portfolio, and could lead to significant potential upside to the business through eventual commercialization."}
