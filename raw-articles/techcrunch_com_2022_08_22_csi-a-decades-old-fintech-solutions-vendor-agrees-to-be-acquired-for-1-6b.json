(CSI), a provider of payments processing and regulatory compliance services, for $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal. CSI CEO David Culbertson said that the transaction \u2014 which works out to $58 per share of CSI\u2019s common stock \u2014 will enable the company to execute \u201cstrategic plans\u201d to \u201cexpand and diversify\u201d CSI\u2019s various product offerings.\n\nCSI might not be a household name. But according to the Paducah, Kentucky-based company\u2019s website, it\u2019s been around in some form or another since 1965, shortly before it began operating a databank processing center in Madisonville. Throughout the 1980s, CSI built a network of data centers, began selling its first PC software and developed what it claims was one of the first online ATM systems. More recent years saw CSI launch a mobile banking solution and products germane to business intelligence and enterprise risk management.\n\nToday, CSI claims to have nearly 2,600 customers and more than 1,100 employees worldwide.\n\n\u201cFor more than 57 years, CSI has been known as a leader in innovation and customer service. Centerbridge and Bridgeport have deep experience in technology and financial services as owners and operators,\u201d Culbertson said in a press release.\n\nCenterbridge and Bridgeport note that the deal, if approved by shareholders and regulators as they expect in Q4 2022, will net CSI shareholders a 53% premium over CSI\u2019s closing stock price as of August 19. CSI\u2019s board unanimously approved the plan to take the company private; post-acquisition, its stock will no longer be listed on the public market.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to have this opportunity to partner with Centerbridge on the acquisition of CSI, a company that I have followed closely for decades and have respected as a real leader in financial services and technology,\u201d Bridgeport founder Frank Martire said in a statement. \u201cCSI has always been known for its commitment to its customers, employees, partners and the communities it serves \u2014 a reputation that Centerbridge and Bridgeport are committed to maintaining while we work together with David and his team to implement the company\u2019s growth initiatives.\u201d\n\nCompliance angle aside, fintechs continue to attract a large portion of investors\u2019 dollars. Venture capital firms invested $28.8 billion into fintech and crypto companies in Q1 2022, amounting to $1 out of every $5 invested, according to CB Insights. Last year, VCs pumped $132.5 billion into the sector \u2014 over double the amount compared to 2020 ($49 billion).\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

A more recent CB Insights report found that fintech and regtech investments declined year-over-year in Q2 2022, reflecting fears of a recession \u2014 as well as of rising interest rates and inflation \u2014 and the implications for the financial services industry."}
