You may want to switch off the new AI features because you are concerned about the AI industry\u2019s impact on the environment or some of the political views of the industry\u2019s top players, or you just don\u2019t think it works very well right now \u2014 something that has so far been proven true with Apple Intelligence, so much so that there\u2019s an entire subreddit dedicated to its fails.\n\nWe are here to help you switch off Apple Intelligence from your devices, a process which should be the same for iPhones, iPads, and Macs \u2014 and it\u2019s relatively straightforward.\n\nGo to Settings on iOS, or System Settings on Mac, and then tap or click on Apple Intelligence.\n\nOn Mac, if it\u2019s switched on, turn it off by clicking on the toggle. You may also want to switch off Siri here as well.\n\nImage Credits:Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\n\nYou will have to confirm you want to stop using Apple Intelligence in a dialog that will open once you click on the toggle.\n\nImage Credits:Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\n\nOn iOS, when you open the Settings app, scroll down to Apple Intelligence & Siri and tap on the toggle to turn it off. You can turn off Siri here too, which we suggest for privacy and security reasons, especially related to Siri on the lock screen.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In practice, this means no personal data ever touches the company Apple Intelligence servers."}
