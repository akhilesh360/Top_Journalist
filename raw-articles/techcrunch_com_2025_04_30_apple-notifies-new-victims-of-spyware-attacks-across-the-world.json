Other tech companies, like Google and WhatsApp, have in recent years also periodically sent such notifications to their users.\n\nAs of Wednesday, only two people appear to have come forward to reveal they were among those who received the notifications from Apple this week.\n\nOne is Ciro Pellegrino, an Italian journalist who works for online news outlet Fanpage. Pellegrino wrote in an article that he received an email and a text message from Apple on Tuesday notifying him that he was targeted with spyware. The message, according to Pellegrino, also said he wasn\u2019t the only person targeted.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s notification is being sent to affected users in 100 countries,\u201d the message read, according to Pellegrino\u2019s article.\n\n\u201cDid this really happen? Yes, it is not a joke,\u201d Pellegrino wrote.\n\nThe second person to receive an Apple notification is Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch right-wing activist, who posted on X on Wednesday.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Although it\u2019s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning \u2014 please take it seriously.\u201d\n\nReacting to the notification, Vlaardingerbroek said that this was an \u201cattempt to intimidate me, an attempt to silence me, obviously.\u201d\n\nNeither Pellegrino nor Vlaardingerbroek responded to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about government hacking groups, zero-day developers, or spyware makers?

Apple has notified users across dozens of countries on two occasions last year that they were targeted by unspecified spyware.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPellegrino is the second Italian journalist this year to have been notified of being a target of this type of spyware, which is sometimes also referred to as \u201cmercenary\u201d spyware, given that it is often developed by companies who then sell the technology to governments.\n\nIn February, WhatsApp notified Pellegrino\u2019s Fanpage colleague Francesco Cancellato that the company \u201cinterrupted the activities of a spyware company which we believe attacked your device.\u201d\n\nIn Cancellato\u2019s case, according to WhatsApp, the spyware was made by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli company. Citizen Lab, a digital rights organization that has investigated spyware for more than a decade, confirmed they were investigating these attacks targeted at WhatsApp users.\n\nAfter Cancellato came forward, another two Italians, who work for Mediterranea Saving Humans, a non-government organization that helps rescue immigrants, also said they were targets of Paragon.\n\nParagon reportedly cut ties with its Italian government customer following these revelations."}
