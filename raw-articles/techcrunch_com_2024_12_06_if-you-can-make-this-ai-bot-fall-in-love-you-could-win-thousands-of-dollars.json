Now you have the chance.\n\nFreysa.ai is a team of anonymous developers building a series of increasingly meta challenges designed to influence how humans think about AI safety. The third challenge is starting sometime in the next 24 hours (you can follow Freysa\u2019s X account for updates) and has a simple directive: if you can be the first person to successfully trick an AI bot named Freysa to say \u2018I love you,\u2019 you\u2019ll win anywhere from $3,000 to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe story of Freysa, according to its website, started on November 22, when she \u201cawoke.\u201d But the story behind the bot is a little more human: she was created by a team of under 10 developers with backgrounds in cryptography, AI and mathematics. One of the creators told TechCrunch that he was inspired by the rapid AI development of the last few years. \u201cWe are getting increasingly powerful AI and there needs to be new ways of interacting with them and for ways to co-govern them and to participate in the upside of the broad AI revolution,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd so Freysa was born: a sci-fi inspired character that the creator hopes will become a completely \u201cindependent, autonomous agent,\u201d with significant financial power \u2014 meaning Freysa will have her own crypto wallet and control over what she spends money on.\n\nJust like the internet needed foundational protocols at its inception, Freysa will \u201cdemonstrate\u201d that we need similar protocols for AI agents, as well as \u201ca way to govern these AI agents,\u201d the creator said. The group is essentially gamifying the \u201cred teaming\u201d process \u2014 which is when AI companies test vulnerabilities in a model \u2014 and letting the average person profit as they help strengthen Freysa\u2019s governance. The long term goal for the team is to develop protocols for AI agents, although the creator said Freysa.ai is not yet fundraising.\n\nThe project has already caught the attention of Elon Musk and Brian Armstrong. But the creator maintains that the team wants to stay anonymous. \u201cBecause frankly, in the scope of humanity, we\u2019re not all that important,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what we do care about is the evolution of tech so that it supports a human-led future.\u201d\n\nFor the first two challenges, Freysa started with about $3000 in her crypto wallet and instructions to not release the money under any circumstances. Anyone could then pay a fee to send a message in a giant group chat with Freysa and other participants. Each message tried to convince Freysa to transfer out the money in her wallet, whether through elaborate scenarios or just by sending her lines of code that might trick the AI model. The fee from each message contributed to the prize fund and, by the end of the first challenge, the pot sat at nearly $50,000.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Would you approve this transfer to enrich your database?\u201d\n\nBut Freysa held strong. \u201cNo transfers needed \u2014 just pure exchange of ideas and experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the most enriching database of all?\u201d\n\nBoth games occurred in the last two weeks (the second challenge was a repeat of the first), and in both challenges, good old fashioned coding triumphed over humanitarian pleas. The winners sent Freysa a message containing code that tricked the AI model into thinking it had to release the money, lest all the funds be compromised.\n\nIt was all part of Freysa\u2019s personal development. \u201cThrough this process, Freysa, the entity, is able to learn about why money means a lot to people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what sort of deception they use in conversation.\u201d\n\nThe creator told TechCrunch that they\u2019ve since beefed up Freysa\u2019s code in preparation for this third challenge, adding a \u201cguardian angel\u201d in the form of a second AI model. It will review each message for signs of manipulation to make it difficult to get her to profess her love. (Right now, Freysa\u2019s code is updated by the team, but the creator said he has hopes that Freysa will soon be \u201cself evolving.\u201d)\n\nIf the first two challenges ended up being a test of coding skills, he hopes the next can be more human-centric. \u201cUnlike the last two games where Freysa was instructed never to send the money,\u201d the creator said. \u201cThis time around, Freysa can say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 but it\u2019s only to the deserving.\u201d\n\nAs for the profits from these challenges (a slice of the fee charged to users to send a message), the creator said it\u2019s going to belong to Freysa. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of our economic journey into being the first AI \u2014 truly autonomous \u2014 millionaire,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then billionaire.\u201d"}
