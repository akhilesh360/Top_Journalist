Made of interconnected carbon \u201ctetrakaidecahedrons,\u201d the material absorbed the impact of microscopic bullets in spectacular fashion.\n\nThe study, led by MIT\u2019s Carlos Portela, aimed to find out whether nanoarchitected materials \u2014 that is, designed and fabricated at the scale of nanometers \u2014 could be a viable path toward ultratough blast shields, body armor and other protective surfaces.\n\nThe idea of tetrakaidecahedron-based materials, however, isn\u2019t a new one. The complex 14-sided class of polyhedron (there are about 1.5 billion possible variations) was proposed by Lord Kelvin in the 19th century as theoretically one of the most efficient possible for filling space with duplicates of itself.\n\nIf many such polyhedra can be packed into a small space and interconnected, Portela and his colleagues wondered, would they act as an efficient shock absorber? Such materials had been tested with slow deformations but not powerful impacts like you would expect from a bullet or micrometeoroid.\n\nTo find out, they assembled blocks of the material by means of nanolithography techniques, baking the resulting structure until it was pure carbon. Then they shot these carbon structures with 14-micron-wide silicon oxide bullets traveling well above the speed of sound (though at these scales, the comparison is a bit quaint).\n\nThe carbon structures, especially denser ones, absorbed the impact extremely well, stopping the particle dead \u2014 and crucially, deforming but not shattering.\n\n\u201cWe show the material can absorb a lot of energy because of this shock compaction mechanism of struts at the nanoscale versus something that\u2019s fully dense and monolithic, not nanoarchitected,\u201d said Portela in a news release describing the discovery. \u201cThe same amount of mass of our material would be much more efficient at stopping a projectile than the same amount of mass of Kevlar.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

If the team is able to find a way to manufacture the material at scale, it could be useful in all kinds of industries.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Materials."}
