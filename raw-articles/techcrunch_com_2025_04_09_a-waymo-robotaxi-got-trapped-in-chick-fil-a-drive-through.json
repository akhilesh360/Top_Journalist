Waymo confirmed the incident, which was first reported by local broadcast station KTLA 5, to TechCrunch via email.\n\nWaymo told TechCrunch that there weren\u2019t any passengers in the robotaxi. The Waymo robotaxi had dropped off a passenger in the parking lot of the Chick-fil-A. However, the robotaxi was unable to complete a multi-point turn due to the proximity of the drive-through lane and multiple other cars in the tight space, according to the company.\n\nThere were no injuries in this case \u2014 just inconveniences for those waiting to order food.\n\nThere have been periodic problems \u2014 often highlighted by videos shared on social media \u2014 with Waymo robotaxis impeding traffic or otherwise causing disturbances. In the past year, a Waymo has gotten stuck in a roundabout loop, while another stalled in front of former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 motorcade in San Francisco. And a parking lot full of Waymos honked for up to an hour during the early morning hours.\n\nWaymo operates a commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. The company also has a robotaxi service in Austin through a partnership with Uber."}
