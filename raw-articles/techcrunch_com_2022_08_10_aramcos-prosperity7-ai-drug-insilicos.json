The new round was \u201coversubscribed\u201d, the firm\u2019s founder and CEO Alex Zhavoronkov told TechCrunch, declining to disclose the company\u2019s valuation.\n\nProsperity7, the venture capital arm of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company Aramco, led the new capital infusion. The fund has been actively scouring for opportunities in and around China that can scale globally and particularly in the Middle East.\n\nInsilico, which operates R&D teams across Hong Kong, Shanghai and New York, seems to be a good fit for Prosperity7.\n\n\u201cProsperity7 inspired us to look into sustainable chemistry,\u201d said Zhavoronkov. Insilico uses machine learning to identify potential drug targets and eventually create the drug. The same technology can also be applied to find novel and useful molecules for sustainable chemistry, an emerging area to which Aramco has devoted much effort, the founder explained.\n\nSustainable chemistry, as defined by OECD, is \u201ca scientific concept that seeks to improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and services.\u201d It \u201cencompasses the design, manufacture, and use of efficient, effective, safe and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes.\u201d\n\nOther investors from the round include an unnamed \u201clarge, diversified asset management firm on the U.S. West Coast,\u201d and an assortment of financial and strategic investors like BHR Partners, Warburg Pincus, B Capital Group, Qiming Venture Partners, Deerfield, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, BOLD Capital Partners, and Pavilion Capital.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

China, exemplified by cities like Wuxi, has in recent years emerged as a popular CRO hub for international pharma companies.\n\nThe founder was also keen to speak about the company\u2019s new dual-CEO structure. He recently promoted GSK veteran Dr. Feng Ren to be his co-CEO, who is now overseeing Insilico\u2019s R&D and drug business, while Zhavoronkov focuses on the firm\u2019s AI platform.\n\n\u201cRen generates a lot of proprietary data for us to train AI to do better than humans. We can use this internally for drug discovery and then export this tech to the rest of the industry,\u201d Zhavoronkov said."}
