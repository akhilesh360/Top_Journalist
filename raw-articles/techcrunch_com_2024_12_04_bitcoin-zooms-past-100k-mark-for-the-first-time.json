On Wednesday, Trump selected Paul Atkins, a crypto proponent, as the chairman for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nUnder Biden, the SEC has taken legal action against crypto exchanges like Coinbase, claiming that some crypto tokens sold through the platforms were actually unregistered securities. The crypto industry donated $245 million during the election cycle, according to CNBC.\n\nReuters reported that because of Trump\u2019s pro-crypto stance, small businesses are shifting some of their investments from cash to crypto.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has jumped about 50% since election day and is up more than 100% for the year overall."}
