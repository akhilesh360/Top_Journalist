This open source data visualization project has been around since 2016. But companies like Google and Samsung are increasingly relying on this rich dataset to hit their sustainability goals and empower their own users.\n\nThere are currently 20 people working for Electricity Maps and the company has been profitable for a few years. But TechCrunch has exclusively learned it recently raised a $5.4 million (\u20ac5 million) funding round from Transition and Revent, to take things up a notch by investing in the product and the business. Electricity Maps is now both a data visualization tool and an enterprise API for data-driven decarbonization \u2014 and one wouldn\u2019t work without the other.\n\nFounded by Olivier Corradi, a French and Danish entrepreneur and data scientist who previously worked for voice assistant startup Snips, Electricity Maps started from an itch to know more about electricity production and consumption. \u201cThere were articles in the press saying that Denmark ran on 100% renewable energy for a day. So I was wondering whether this was true and how long it lasted \u2014 how many hours in the day,\u201d Corradi told TechCrunch.\n\nImage Credits:Electricity Maps\n\nElectricity Maps aggregates real-time data for electricity production in more than 50 countries around the world. While the company uses open-data sources, employees and community contributors had to build dozens of parsers to standardize this data.\n\nAs renewable energy depends on weather conditions (for wind and solar energy in particular), the mix of energy sources constantly evolves. It means that the carbon intensity of the energy produced also changes with the time of the day and the current conditions. And, as you may have guessed, as electricity works a bit like tap water flowing through a vast network of tubes, the CO 2 emissions related to the electricity you consume can vary greatly.\n\nCalculating the CO 2 emissions can be complicated, as there are also a lot of cross-border flows for electricity \u2014 some countries produce more electricity than they actually consume while others have larger electricity needs than production capacity. Electricity Maps has designed its own flow-tracing model to understand which power plant contributes to the electricity you\u2019re consuming right now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to process all this in our system with what we call a flow-tracing algorithm, which lets us tell you where the electricity is coming from depending on where you are. It can be produced locally, but it can also come from Germany. But Germany imports from Poland, so it could potentially come from Poland, etc. So we need to perform some modelling,\u201d Corradi said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Just like weather APIs are now a big industry, electricity forecasting APIs could become essential business tools in the future.\n\nElectricity Maps founder and CEO Olivier Corradi.

Calculating the life cycle emissions for electricity generation requires peer-reviewed studies.\n\nThe company shares all its sources for emission factors. It also means that these calculation methods can evolve over time as researchers release new studies with more accurate results. The community can discuss and submit potential changes that will be reflected in Electricity Maps\u2019 data.\n\nAs for the commercial part, being able to know the carbon intensity of the electricity that is available at a specific place and a specific time can be a sort of superpower.\n\n\u201cWith all the renewable energy installation goals, we\u2019re going to find ourselves in a world where the quantity of intermittent renewable energy will triple by 2030,\u201d Corradi said.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that this demand is flexible because it\u2019s going to be electric cars and you can change the time at which they charge. It\u2019s going to be AI training and you can choose the time at which you\u2019re going to train these big models,\u201d he added.\n\nImage Credits:Electricity Maps\n\nGoogle, one of Electricity Maps\u2019 most important clients, partnered with the European startup to calculate the carbon intensity of the electricity powering its data centers.\n\nFor some tasks, such as indexing the web or training a new AI model, Google can use Electricity Maps\u2019 data for load shifting. When there\u2019s more wind, it\u2019s time to boot up additional servers. Or when it\u2019s nighttime in the U.S., Google can move some compute-intensive operations to European data centers.\n\nBut Google\u2019s own clients will also benefit from the company\u2019s partnership with Electricity Maps. With the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, many companies will soon have to publish carbon accounting reports. As many companies rely on Google Cloud for their hosting needs, they will need data to calculate their scope 3 emissions. Thanks to Electricity Maps\u2019 historical data, that carbon data will be more accurate.\n\nSamsung, another client for Electricity Maps, uses the startup\u2019s data to show users the electricity usage and carbon footprint of their Samsung devices. In that case, this is more about educating users.\n\nBut Electricity Maps is much more than an educational tool. It can act as the information layer that decides whether it\u2019s a good time to turn on millions of electric devices \u2014 or, at least, if it\u2019s a good time to have as little impact as possible on the planet.\n\nWhy is a profitable company raising? The funding injection is aimed at dialing up Electricity Maps\u2019 own impact by stepping on the gas so it can meet rising demand for smarter climate tools, per Corradi. \u201cThe reason we raised is simply that the amount of renewable energy now in the system is starting to be so significant that you\u2019re starting to have an opportunity to activate the flexibility of the appliances you have at home, or in the industrial sector.\u201d"}
