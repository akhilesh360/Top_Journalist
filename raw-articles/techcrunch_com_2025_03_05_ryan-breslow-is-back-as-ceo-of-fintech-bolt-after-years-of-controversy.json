Grooms, the company\u2019s former director of sales, took over as CEO after Maju Kuruvilla was reportedly removed by Bolt\u2019s board.\n\nBreslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. Over the years, he has faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow was also embroiled in a legal battle with investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan he took out. Last September, Bolt shared that it had reached a settlement with Activant Capital. That settlement stipulated that Bolt would repurchase Activant\u2019s shares of Bolt stock, after which Activant would no longer hold any interest in the company.\n\nIn the communication to investors, as seen by TechCrunch, Breslow thanked the company\u2019s backers for their \u201csupport and encouragement\u201d and expressed gratitude to employees.\n\nLast year, Bolt was reportedly trying to raise $200 million in equity and an unusual, additional $250 million in \u201cmarketing credits,\u201d at a $14 billion valuation. As part of the funding round, Breslow would be re-instated as CEO. By September that deal had apparently stalled. Today, Bolt told TechCrunch that it could not comment on the fundraise.\n\nBolt\u2019s annualized run rate was at $28 million in revenue and the company had $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March of 2024, journalist Eric Newcomer, who also saw copies of the leaked term sheet, reported last August. A valuation of $14 billion would be an enormous multiple over such numbers and higher than that $11 billion valuation achieved in January of 2022.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
