Brightseed has found a couple of them, anyway, using an AI-based analysis method and will be bringing its first products to market soon with the help of a $68 million B round.\n\nBrightseed\u2019s thesis is simply that there are almost certainly some very helpful and healthy substances waiting in plants, which have yet to be either discovered or popularized. As many of our medicines and vitamins are plant-derived, it\u2019s hardly a controversial idea \u2014 but how can you sort through the countless compounds that plants make and are made up of?\n\nThe company\u2019s answer is Forager, a machine learning platform that identifies and categorizes plant compounds at a very fast clip; they\u2019ve already mapped two million, considerably more than are characterized in scientific literature.\n\nOf course they\u2019re not all winners, but the system helps pick out ones that are more likely to be beneficially bioactive, either unstudied or analogous to existing compounds.\n\nThis process has historically been done in labs, where you painstakingly test thousands of substances to see if there\u2019s any effect, something that takes years and is horribly wasteful. But as we\u2019re seeing elsewhere in the drug discovery space, AI can cut through the noise and eliminate the vast majority of these substances, surfacing the best of the best. Brightseed claims it was about a hundred times faster, and much cheaper, than standard screening processes.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

No one is trying to lose a few pounds specifically from their liver. Though the substance expects a \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d rating from the FDA, it\u2019s a long way from being prescribed for acute conditions.\n\nThat said, there is a huge demand for supplements with potentially large benefits and no known issues. Who reading this doesn\u2019t have a couple bottles of this or that for joint health or better sleep? There is evidence backing these up, just as there is for NCT and NFT, which are in human clinical trials after some basic initial mouse models and human safety testing.\n\n\u201cA growing body of scientific research highlights the central role that natural dietary bioactives play in reducing the risk of many chronic diseases and health conditions, and longevity,\u201d co-founder and CEO Jim Flatt told TechCrunch. \u201cThe application of AI to large biology data sets is enabling a new golden era of discovery that can solve our most pressing needs in healthcare, and that is where Brightseed is focused today.\u201d\n\nThe AI side of things is going to be expanding to cover more areas of health needs and sets of substances, eventually looking at fungi and bacteria as well as plants. \u201cDozens are in various stages of validation,\u201d Flatt said.\n\nMore immediately, though, and powered by the $68 million, \u201cwe are expanding our data business and launching our novel bioactive ingredients business, based on our clinically studied natural bioactives.\u201d\n\nIn other words, commercialization; the company cited Danone, Ocean Spray and Pharmavite as existing partners, though not necessarily just for NCT and NFT products. It isn\u2019t just signing over the rights, either; it\u2019ll be producing the substances itself at a facility in Raleigh, where it plans to hire up and then scale up.\n\n\u201cForager sees deeper into plants and nature than we\u2019ve ever been able to see before,\u201d said Flatt. \u201cThat vision, paired with insight and validation, is unlocking new opportunities for companies across the health continuum, and ultimately a future where health solutions are both natural and scientifically validated.\u201d\n\nThe latest round added Temasek as lead investor, with participation from previous investors Lewis & Clark AgriFood, Seed 2 Growth (now S2G) Ventures, CGC Ventures, Germin8 and AgFunder.\n\n(The headline of this article originally misstated the round as an A round; it\u2019s definitely a B round. My mistake.)"}
