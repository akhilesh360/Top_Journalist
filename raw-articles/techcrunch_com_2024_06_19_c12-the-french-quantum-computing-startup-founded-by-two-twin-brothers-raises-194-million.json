Originally founded in 2020 as a spinoff from the Physics Laboratory of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, the company has been working on a unique process to create quantum computers based on carbon nanotubes.\n\nWhile the concept of quantum computing isn\u2019t new, it is still very much a work in progress. Many scientific teams have been approaching this topic from different angles. The goal is to create a quantum computer at scale that can execute calculations with a low amount of errors.\n\nBut wait, why do we need quantum computers in the first place? Computers as they exist today are entirely based on electronic transistors. And we\u2019ve become really good at making transistors smaller so we can pack more of them in a single chip. As a result, computing power has progressed at an exponential pace over the past 60 years.\n\nAnd yet, the current computer architecture has its limits. Even if companies start building bigger data centers, some problems simply can\u2019t be solved with traditional computers. It is also unclear whether Moore\u2019s law will remain valid in the years to come.\n\nThis is where quantum computers could prove useful.\n\n\u201cIf we want to create a model \u2014 an exhaustive simulation of a chemical reaction \u2014 to know how new drugs are going to interact with our cells, that\u2019s not possible with a conventional approach,\u201d C12 co-founder and CEO Pierre Desjardins (pictured right) told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cThere are a whole host of optimization problems to be solved, whether in transport, logistics or manufacturing. They are impossible to run on a conventional computer because there will be too many variables, too many possible scenarios,\u201d he continued.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

At some point in our conversation, Pierre even called his brother a \u201cscientific genius.\u201d\n\nAnd because it\u2019s 2024, there\u2019s even an AI angle that should convince you that quantum computing research is important. \u201cToday, training a large language model also means consuming an enormous amount of energy,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cAnd quantum is also a computing method that uses much less energy.\u201d\n\nHow to build a quantum computer\n\nC12 says the two key differences with the other teams working on quantum computers are that it uses a different material (carbon nanotubes) and it has a specific manufacturing process (a nano-assembly process that is now patented).\n\n\u201cToday, I think we are the only ones in the world to control this very special process, which involves putting a carbon nanotube on top of a silicon chip. And what\u2019s absolutely fascinating is the scale. The diameter of a carbon nanotube is 10,000 times smaller than a human hair,\u201d Pierre said.\n\nImage Credits:C12\n\nResearch teams working for big companies like Google, IBM or Amazon are currently focusing on a different process. Most of them are using superconducting materials, such as aluminum, on top of a silicon substrate.\n\nAccording to C12, this method has led to early breakthroughs. However, using aluminum isn\u2019t going to work at scale due to interferences as you start adding more qubits. While quantum isn\u2019t mature yet, C12 believes it is working on next-generation quantum computing compared to these aluminum-based processes.\n\nThe company has set up its first production line in a basement near the Pantheon in Paris. In this facility, they manufacture carbon nanotubes, control those tubes and then integrate them with the silicon substrate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now up and running. Today, we produce about one chip a week, which we then test in our mini data center,\u201d Pierre said. But don\u2019t expect to see a quantum computer just yet. \u201cWe are still really just validating fundamental elements,\u201d he added. The company is focusing on chips with one or two qubits for the moment.\n\nEmulating quantum\n\nAs research and development work progresses, the C12 team is also working on its business ecosystem. Like many quantum companies, C12 has created an emulator called Callisto. Emulators let developers write and run some quantum code on a classical computer.\n\nThey\u2019re not going to get the results they would get with a quantum computer, but at least they will be ready to hit the ground running when quantum computers are available.\n\n\u201cWe are currently focusing on two verticals, the chemical industry and the energy industry. The chemical industry uses it to simulate chemical reactions and the energy industry uses it mainly for optimization problems,\u201d Pierre said. In particular, the startup has a partnership with Air Liquide.\n\nImage Credits:C12\n\nAnd if we go back to the funding round, Varsity Capital, EIC Fund and Verve Ventures are investing in it; existing investors 360 Capital, Bpifrance\u2019s Digital Venture fund and BNP Paribas De\u0301veloppement are also participating once again in this round.\n\nThere are 45 people from 18 different nationalities working for C12 today, including 22 PhDs. With the recently raised capital, C12 plans to sign more partnerships with industrial partners. But the company also has a research goal.\n\n\u201cThe other goal is to carry out, for the first time, a quantum operation between two qubits that are located at a long distance from each other,\u201d Pierre said. By long distance, he means \u201ctens of micrometers\u201d from each other. It doesn\u2019t seem like much, but it will be key when it comes to scaling quantum computing."}
