The breach affects users of PowerSchool\u2019s school information system, which schools use to manage student records, grades, attendance, and enrollment.\n\nPowerSchool said in its FAQ that while the stolen data primarily includes contact details, such as individuals\u2019 names and addresses, the hackers were also able to access Social Security numbers, some medical and grade information, and other unspecified personally identifiable information belonging to students and teachers.\n\nThe California-based education tech firm, the largest provider of cloud-based education software for K-12 education in the United States, says the personal information of parents and guardians, including names, phone numbers, and email addresses, was also potentially compromised in some school districts. The company said the types of stolen data will vary by customer.\n\nPowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler confirmed the legitimacy of the information in the FAQ on Thursday but declined to say how many individuals are affected by the breach. PowerSchool says its software is used by over 18,000 customers to support more than 60 million students across North America.\n\nIn the FAQ, PowerSchool confirmed that the security incident was not ransomware in nature, but noted that it worked with CyberSteward, a Canadian organization that offers cyber-extortion incident response services, to negotiate with the threat actors responsible for the breach.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

CyberSteward did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cPowerSchool has taken all appropriate steps to prevent the data involved from further unauthorized misuse and does not anticipate the data being shared or made public,\u201d Keebler said. \u201cPowerSchool believes the data has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination.\u201d\n\nPowerSchool was acquired by Bain Capital in 2024 in a $5.6 billion deal. When reached by TechCrunch this week, Bain Capital spokesperson Rachel Colson did not provide comment.\n\nDo you have more information about the PowerSchool data breach?
