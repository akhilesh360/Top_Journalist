Whether the public-offering window opens later this year or early in 2024, TechCrunch+ expects to see a few familiar names in the mix from the HR tech space.\n\nAnd perhaps some less familiar names.\n\nRegular TechCrunch readers are likely familiar with HR-tech unicorns like Rippling, Gusto and Deel, late-stage startups with valuations around or above the $10 billion mark.\n\nVelocity Global is another name to include in the startup cluster. Worth a few billion dollars, its recent growth and profitability mean that when we consider potential exits in the HR technology market, it should be on the list.\n\nThe Exchange explores startups, markets and money.\n\nRead it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n\nEven more fun, Velocity Global CEO Ben Wright shared a grip of financial data about his company with TechCrunch+ recently. The new numbers give us even more perspective into the growth and worth of startups that help other companies run payroll.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

First, the dividing line between running payroll and hiring workers: While Deel and Velocity Global appear more focused on being employers of record (EoR) for domestic companies looking to hire internationally, Rippling and Gusto are more known for running payroll for customers\u2019 domestic workforces. But don\u2019t try to jam the four companies into two distinct groups; Rippling also offers customers the ability to be their co-employer, and both Rippling and Gusto offer support for international staff.\n\nIn short, while the four companies may have started off with a particular focus and geographic bent, they are overlapping more over time as they broaden their product lineup to support more customer use cases and, we presume, to grow their revenue footprint with existing customers.\n\nAs we wait for some brave company to be the first IPO out of the gate, let\u2019s chat through Velocity Global\u2019s numbers and valuation and contrast both with what we know about some of its private-market competition. For you digit-heads out there, we\u2019re going to close with a question about which company\u2019s valuation makes the most sense. Ready? To work.\n\nGrowth\n\nI love a startup cluster. Normally, however, we spot them when they are filled with early-stage startups; for example, we noted the OKR software cohort and the insurtech marketplace troop during the last venture cycle. Given that our payroll group is later stage, we have more information about their individual performance.\n\nVelocity Global started life helping other companies hire in other countries as a services business back in 2014. Per Wright, about five years in, the company decided it needed more technology to run its business. Why? \u201cWe were just getting so big [that we] couldn\u2019t just be a services business anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company initially tried to buy technology off the shelf before building its own software. This timeline helps explain why Velocity Global has a far more impressive history of profitability than most startups, and why it raised capital so much later than most. It raised a $100 million Series A in 2021 and added $400 million last May, bringing its total fundraising to a half billion dollars and a self-reported valuation of $2 billion.\n\nAs with any company with a services origin that pivots into technology, we want to understand its gross margins, which are a great way to get a gut check on whether we\u2019re looking at a services company with a tech side hustle or a tech company that may retain more services DNA than other startups.\n\nTechCrunch+ asked Wright about his company\u2019s revenue mix and margins, to which the CEO responded that in the case of gross margins, \u201cyou can look at public-market comps for SaaS companies of our size and larger, and we are right in that sweet spot.\u201d That implies that Velocity Global has evolved into a tech business and that we can confidently bucket its revenue with unicorn peers. (We vet every company\u2019s pre-IPO comments when they do go public, so expect a fact check on all of this when the four companies debut.)\n\nSo what does Velocity Global have to back up its $2 billion price tag? Per the company, it has surpassed $200 million worth of annual recurring revenue, is growing around 40% organically (sans acquisitions) and was profitable in seven of its nine years of operation.\n\nOn the profit basis, Wright\u2019s company uses adjusted EBITDA as its measuring stick, though the CEO did say that the adjustments aren\u2019t massive \u2014 he joked that Velocity Global is not using something akin to WeWork\u2019s infamous community-adjusted EBITDA metric \u2014 and that his company\u2019s adjusted profitability is close to an unadjusted EBITDA figure.\n\nFair enough. Adjusted EBITDA is popular with tech companies because of their penchant for paying employees partially in stock, so we\u2019re accustomed to it, even if we prefer GAAP net income.\n\nVelocity Global is clearly an IPO candidate; growth, nine-figure revenue and a history of profitability are the traditional requirements for a public debut. Now, let\u2019s get some more numbers to play with.\n\nCompetitive metrics\n\nHow do Velocity Global\u2019s numbers and valuation stack up against its competition? A few notes:\n\nDeel recently announced that it reached $295 million worth of ARR at the end of 2022, up from $57 million at the close of 2021. When Deel crossed the $100 million ARR milestone in early 2022, we asked the company about its own gross margins \u2014 we\u2019re consistent, at least \u2014 which it said were slightly above average for SaaS companies.\n\nrecently announced that it reached $295 million worth of ARR at the end of 2022, up from $57 million at the close of 2021.

Deel is worth around $12 billion and also claims EBITDA positivity since September of last year. At its end of 2022 valuation and recurring revenue, the company sported an ARR multiple of around 41x.\n\nis worth around $12 billion and also claims EBITDA positivity since September of last year.

Gusto told TechCrunch+ this week that it crossed the 300,000 customer threshold at the end of 2022, up from 200,000 in August 2021, when it shared that it had closed its most recent funding round, a $175 million investment that pushed its valuation to $9.5 billion.\n\ntold TechCrunch+ this week that it crossed the 300,000 customer threshold at the end of 2022, up from 200,000 in August 2021, when it shared that it had closed its most recent funding round, a $175 million investment that pushed its valuation to $9.5 billion. Gusto revenue is harder to pin down, but in late 2021, Forbes reported that the company\u2019s CEO said that it had \u201cseveral hundred million dollars\u201d worth of annual revenue, a figure that was growing \u201csteadily at 50% year-over-year.\u201d\n\nrevenue is harder to pin down, but in late 2021, Forbes reported that the company\u2019s CEO said that it had \u201cseveral hundred million dollars\u201d worth of annual revenue, a figure that was growing \u201csteadily at 50% year-over-year.\u201d Rippling recently told Reuters that it has over $100 million worth of ARR and more than 400,000 \u201cusers across industries from retail to healthcare.\u201d Reuters also notes that the company is more than doubling each year.\n\nrecently told Reuters that it has over $100 million worth of ARR and more than 400,000 \u201cusers across industries from retail to healthcare.\u201d Reuters also notes that the company is more than doubling each year. Rippling\u2019s numbers are a bit more restrained than others; I presume that its revenue figure is a lowball disclosure given the size of its customer base and its valuation, recently reaffirmed at $11.25 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of numbers. To help a bit, Deel\u2019s ARR multiple is pretty expensive compared to current market norms for SaaS companies. However, Deel is growing at a bonkers pace, meaning it can likely command a hefty growth premium in its equity pricing. Rippling\u2019s growth rate, in the triple digits, as we understand it, also implies a growth premium to support its valuation and, we presume, an ARR multiple above what we tend to see on the public markets presently.\n\nVelocity Global and Gusto are growing a bit slower, but without more precise numbers from Gusto, we cannot compare them directly. Velocity Global is sitting atop an ARR multiple of around 10x, depending on how far above the $200 million ARR mark the company has scaled. I would hazard that Gusto\u2019s ARR multiple is closer to Velocity Global\u2019s than, say, Deel\u2019s.\n\nThis creates an interesting intellectual exercise: Have private-market investors nailed valuations among the four companies regarding their growth rates and profitability \u2014 it seems that HR-tech companies in the payroll space find it far easier than other software companies to reach EBITDA positivity \u2014 for each to be fairly valued? Or are Velocity Global\u2019s valuation and ARR multiple low?\n\nGiven recent changes to the value of software companies, we\u2019d normally be more willing to argue that the more richly priced startups are expensive, but not in this case. Why? Because we don\u2019t have quite enough data to make that call, and how much of a premium growth is worth today may not be the case when we get to IPO season.\n\nThe takeaway is that we have a cluster of companies in the payroll space with increasingly similar product lines, nine-figure revenue bases and a mix of 10- and 11-figure valuations. Collectively, the companies have raised billions. Yes, that sound you hear is us rubbing our hands together in anticipation of the eventual filings.\n\nSurely no unicorn in high repair will skip the next IPO window, yeah?"}
