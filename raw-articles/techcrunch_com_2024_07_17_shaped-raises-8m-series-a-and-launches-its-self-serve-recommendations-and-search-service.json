Shaped, which is announcing an $8 million Series A funding round today, wants to make it easier for businesses of all sizes to combine the data they already have with large language models and other recommendation systems to offer a personalized user experience.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Shaped is a developer-first platform. With that, its customers gain a high level of flexibility. This includes choosing data sources, integration methods, language models (e.g. Llama, CLIP, BERT) and scoring mechanisms for recommendations and search results.\n\nImage Credits:Shaped\n\nThe company was founded by CEO Tullie Murrell, CPO Daniel Camilleri and Shai Bruhis (who has since moved on to another venture). Murrell previously worked at Meta/Facebook, where he created the PyTorchVideo project and worked on other video-centric AI projects at Facebook AI Research. Camilleri previously worked at Uber and Afterpay. The two first met about 10 years ago, while participating in a hackathon during their student days in Australia.\n\n\u201cHow do we help small businesses build the same kind of hyper-personalized experiences that you\u2019d see in a big tech company? Any of these businesses should be able to do this without having to have thousands of machine learning engineers,\u201d Murrell explained when I asked him about the team\u2019s original vision for Shaped.\n\nToday, Shaped\u2019s customers include brands like the outdoor travel marketplace Outdoorsy, Brazilian grocery delivery app Trela and QVC, which uses it for real-time video recommendations in its mobile app.\n\nDespite launching before the generative AI boom, Shaped was already leveraging many of these cutting-edge techniques due to Murrell\u2019s background in AI research.\n\nImage Credits:Shaped\n\nEarly on, Shaped mostly focused on video personalization, but after going through the Y Combinator program in 2022, the team decided to expand into other areas as well. \u201cGoing through [YC], talking to customers and looking at the market size, we realized, \u2018hey, it\u2019s not the video personalization that really matters here. Why don\u2019t we sell a horizontal personalization platform that can work for all different kinds of media: language, video and audio,\u2019\u201d Murrell said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Having all of this data \u2014 and critically a lot of user interaction data \u2014 is what allows developers to build their custom recommendation systems.\n\nImage Credits:Shaped\n\nThe team stressed that its focus is on the developer experience. Shaped doesn\u2019t necessarily cater to a marketing persona but instead aims to give developers the tools and data to build and test these systems. And while the service is mostly code-first, this includes a dashboard that allows them to test their models and examine why the system is giving certain recommendations.\n\nMore recently, Shaped also expanded more deeply into search. \u201cWe have all this semantic understanding about the users and content, so it\u2019s actually quite easy for us to add on the search packaging. That\u2019s actually a big part of our focus over the next year, becoming this full discovery platform,\u201d Murrell said.\n\nShaped\u2019s Series A round was led by Madrona Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator and executives and founders from Clickhouse, Docusign, Okta, Rippling and StitchFix.\n\n\u201cWe first met Shaped CEO and Co-Founder Tullie Murrell over a year ago and were extremely impressed with his understanding of recommendation systems, having built and researched many of these systems while at Meta,\u201d Madrona\u2019s Karan Mehandru and Sabrina Wu wrote in a blog post today. \u201cHe has perfect founder-market fit, deep empathy for the customer, and a nuanced understanding of the market and the opportunities. We\u2019ve also had the pleasure of getting to know Dan, Ben, and the rest of the Shaped team, who bring a wealth of experience from Uber, Apple, and other iconic companies.\u201d"}
