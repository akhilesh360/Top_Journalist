Some of Alan\u2019s existing investors are participating once again, namely Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan (via Teachers\u2019 Venture Growth), Temasek, Coatue, and Lakestar.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with Alan, the company originally started with a health insurance product that complements the national healthcare system in France. French companies must provide health insurance to all their employees when they join.\n\nAlan has optimized its core product as much as possible so that its user experience is much better than a legacy insurance provider\u2019s. For instance, Alan has automated many parts of the claim management system. In some cases, you get a reimbursement on your bank account just a minute after leaving the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nOver time, the company added other health-related services, such as the ability to chat with doctors, order prescription glasses, and use preventive care content on mental health, back pain and more via its mobile app. More recently, the company has turned to AI to increase its productivity.\n\nEarlier this year, Alan shared some metrics about the company\u2019s performance. The company had said that over 500,000 people were covered by Alan\u2019s insurance products, and it could reach profitability without raising another funding round.\n\nBut Alan said the partnership with Belfius was a good opportunity to grow its customer base in Belgium \u2014 the bank will offer the startup\u2019s health insurance products to its own corporate and institutional clients, which represent millions of employees.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Belfius\u2019 investment will allow us to accelerate our development and expand our capacity to offer cutting-edge, accessible health products and services to a wide audience,\u201d Alan\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve, said in a statement.\n\nSince February, Alan has added another 150,000 customers, including at the Prime Minister\u2019s office in France. It expects its annual recurring revenue to reach \u20ac450 million (around $500 million) this year.\n\nHowever, Alan isn\u2019t a typical software-as-a-service company, and most of its revenue is set aside to fulfill insurance claims. Still, one thing is for sure \u2014 the company\u2019s growth doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down."}
