The franchise also made a splash this year with a Hollywood film and the hugely successful Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, a video game that licenses Dungeons & Dragons IP.\n\nResolution is known for its game Demeo, which re-creates the tabletop gaming experience digitally, whether that\u2019s on a VR headset, like the Meta Quest or the Apple Vision Pro, or just on an iPad.\n\nThe details of the deal aren\u2019t apparent \u2014 is Wizards just licensing the IP, or working with Resolution? \u2014 but it continues Wizards\u2019 trend of bringing Dungeons & Dragons away from the table and into digital media. It\u2019s also not clear whether this is a platform for players to connect with their friends to play D&D through VR, or if they\u2019re telling a whole new story, like the \u201cHonor Among Thieves\u201d film. But in trailers for Demeo, it seems that players are quite literally using VR hand-tracking to play cards and paint virtual miniatures, so perhaps the collaboration will be more like a virtual tabletop than a single-player story game.\n\nIt\u2019s common for people to use platforms like Foundry and Roll20 to play D&D with non-local friends, and Baldur\u2019s Gate was a hit, but . . . are we really trying to eldritch blast our enemies in VR? D&D sessions usually extend for two to three hours (or longer, if you\u2019re extra dedicated), and even when you\u2019re having a great time with your pals, your attention can waver a little bit. Does anyone really want to wear a headset for a whole D&D session?\n\nThe news comes shortly after mass layoffs hit Hasbro, Wizards\u2019 parent company. In the division of the company that runs Wizards and digital gaming, revenue is up 40% year over year to $423.6 million, netting a $203.4 million operating profit; overall, however, Hasbro\u2019s revenue is down 10%. Even though Wizards has been thriving, its department at Hasbro was not spared from layoffs."}
