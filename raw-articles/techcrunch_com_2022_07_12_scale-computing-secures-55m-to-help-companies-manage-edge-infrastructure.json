According to a 2021 survey (albeit from an edge computing services vendor), 77% of companies said that they expect to see more spending for edge projects in 2022. But while some organizations stand to benefit from edge computing, which refers to the practice of storing and analyzing data near the end-user, not all have a handle of what it requires. Managing a fleet of edge devices across locations can be a burden on IT teams that lack the necessary infrastructure.\n\nJeff Ready asserts that his company, Scale Computing, can help enterprises that aren\u2019t sure where to start with edge computing via storage architecture and disaster recovery technologies. Ready \u2014 who, among other ventures, runs a beer brewing company in Indianapolis \u2014 co-launched Scale Computing in 2007 with Jason Collier and Scott Loughmiller.\n\nBoth Loughmiller and Collier worked at Tumbleweed Communications developing a messaging and file transfer platform for enterprise and government customers. Prior to Scale, Ready, Loughmiller and Collier co-founded Corvigo, which offered a spam-filtering tool for email.\n\nEarly on, Scale focused on selling servers loaded with custom storage software targeting small- and medium-sized businesses. But the company later pivoted to \u201chyperconverged\u201d infrastructure and edge computing products, which virtualizes customers\u2019 infrastructure by combining servers, storage, a virtual machine monitor called a hypervisor and backup and data recovery into a single system.\n\n\u201cScale Computing engineered an IT infrastructure platform that \u2026 eliminates the need for traditional IT silos of virtualization software, disaster recovery software, servers, and shared storage, replacing these with a fully integrated, highly available platform for running applications,\u201d Ready said in an email interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThe self-healing platform automatically identifies, mitigates, and corrects problems in the infrastructure in real time, enabling applications to achieve maximum uptime even when local IT resources and staff are scarce.\u201d\n\nThose are lofty promises. But \u2014 lending Scale credibility \u2014 the company today raised $55 million in new funding led by Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital, bringing Scale\u2019s total raised to $202 million.\n\n\u201cThe technological advantage of Scale Computing\u2019s edge computing platform solves endemic customer problems through enhanced resiliency, manageability and efficacy of their IT infrastructures,\u201d Pete D. Chung, managing director and head of Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital, told TechCrunch in a statement. \u201cIt was clear from our diligence that Scale Computing\u2019s customers benefit from material cost savings as well as increased confidence in their IT infrastructure.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company\u2019s device management tool gives users the ability to see a fleet of devices from a console and optionally check their health, flagging problems automatically and logging them so that IT teams can arrive at a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cBusinesses across the spectrum of industries are eager to simplify their IT infrastructure, improve business resiliency, and drive down operational costs. The pandemic has also illustrated the importance of having edge computing capabilities outside a large centralized data center,\u201d Ready said. \u201cScale\u2019s software eliminates the need for traditional IT silos of virtualization software, disaster recovery software, servers, and shared storage, replacing these with a fully-integrated, highly-available platform for running applications.\u201d\n\nReady\u2019s language might be hyperbolic, but there\u2019s certainly been growth in the demand for edge computing management software. According to Grand View Research, the global edge computing market \u2014 which was estimated to be worth $7.43 billion in 2021 \u2014 could climb to $155.90 billion in 2030.\n\nReady wouldn\u2019t disclose revenue, and \u2014 perhaps hedging in light of the economic downswing \u2014 demurred when asked whether Scale had plans to expand its 160-person workforce by the end of the year. But he claimed that the company currently has over 6,000 customers across North America, Europe and the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAt one point in time, those customers reportedly included grocery store franchise Jerry\u2019s Enterprises and casino company Genting Group.\n\n\u201cDespite the uncertainty wrought by the pandemic \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 Scale Computing has seen unprecedented demand for its edge computing, virtualization, and hyperconverged solutions,\u201d Ready added in a follow-up email. \u201cWe\u2019ll will use the new funds to expand our leadership position in edge computing, including investments in people, R&D, and restructuring of debt.\u201d"}
