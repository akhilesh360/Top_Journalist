At the time, she didn\u2019t really see herself as someone with a disability, even though it meant spending hours each day hooked up to an IV.\n\nWhen she entered the workforce, she soon was confronted with the difficulties of navigating, disclosing and asking for support around her condition. \u201cI had no clue about this process, but I saw firsthand just how uncomfortable it was.\u201d That lack of knowledge is what would kickstart her entire entrepreneurial journey \u2014 from spending time as a disability employment advisor, to building her first company, Chronically Capable, with a former boss, Kai Keane.\n\nChronically Capable helps people with disabilities and chronic illnesses find flexible jobs, and now, after scaling it for nearly five years, the founding duo has built another company that takes an earlier step in a similar world. Disclo, an Atlanta-based startup, is building software that helps employees ask for accommodation requests at work, and it empowers employers to collect, verify, and manage health disclosures and employee accommodation requests in a HIPAA- and SOC 2\u2013compliant way.\n\nInvestors think it is addressing a real need in the market, with General Catalyst leading a $5 million seed round in Disclo, joined by Y Combinator, Bain Capital Ventures and Lerer Hippeau. With $6.5 million in known funding altogether so far, Disclo has also tucked Chronically Capable underneath its umbrella given the synergies between the two. While Chronically Capable is all about recruiting talent with diverse needs, Disclo helps startups ensure they have a proper accommodations process in place first to support their hiring.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of startups being thoughtful, says Keane, who is the chief product officer (Olson is CEO). It\u2019s about following established regulations.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think about this as going the extra mile \u2014 it\u2019s a compliance issue,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are following the law, and a lot of companies right now don\u2019t know how to or they just aren\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the same time, Disclo hopes its mere existence raises awareness about these regulations, for the benefit of everyone involved. \u201cThere\u2019s some stigma and hush-hush about asking for things at work, and [employers] don\u2019t advertise how to ask for accommodations at work.\u201d Disclo\u2019s job, from Keane\u2019s perspective, is to help employees understand what their rights are and to protect the employer by documenting and standardizing an often unstructured conversation.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Olson said that there has been a 61% increase in accommodation requests from employees \u2014 a stat that she thinks shows the need for employers to take disability requests more seriously.\n\nA key aspect of Disclo\u2019s software is that it anonymizes what an employee\u2019s disability is, instead telling the employer that the individual has filed a disability notice and could use the following accommodations to feel more supported at work. This could help given that not all disabilities are visible, and not every person with a disability feels comfortable declaring that they have one.\n\nOlson\u2019s personal experience underscored how it was both hard to navigate the process of disclosing and find a company that \u201cembraced\u201d what she needed. Disclo doesn\u2019t force startups to provide certain accommodations, but puts a framework in place for a company to be more aware and able to support their employees.\n\nSpeaking of the disorganization that rules many startups, one may ask why the large slew of HR tech startups haven\u2019t sought to disrupt the disability accommodation side of operations. Some startups are forced to use sticky notes and box drives because restrictive laws don\u2019t allow information to be stored inside of human resource platforms, Olson says, while large companies use disability insurance companies.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies think about accommodations from the perspective of insurance claims but accommodations encompass way more than things within the realm of insurance,\u201d she said, such as rescheduling work, bringing in your pet or asking for closed-captioning tools. \u201cThese requests often require a conversation with a manager and we\u2019re here to help facilitate.\u201d\n\nIn that case, maybe tech is just late to the game. Steve O\u2019Hear, a former TechCrunch reporter, wrote about tech companies\u2019 lack of disability reporting in 2016.\n\n\u201cAt its best, technology acts as an enabler for PWDs, helping to level the playing field, and therefore can be a genuine force for social mobility,\u201d O\u2019Hear wrote at the time. \u201cHowever, since disability isn\u2019t included in most technology companies\u2019 public diversity reporting, what we don\u2019t know is how well the technology industry itself is doing with regards to the number of PWDs it employs and how this compares company to company.\u201d Noting the challenges with underreporting and a lack of general transparency around companies, he urged the tech industry to \u201cfind a way to be more accountable.\u201d\n\nDisclo is convinced it is the first software company working on this specific niche. Let\u2019s see if tech is ready to be an early adopter."}
