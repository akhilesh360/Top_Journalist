For example, one of the largest local TV groups in the country has regularly published entertainment and lifestyles content tied to holidays, e.g. \u201cBest Christmas movies of all time, according to critics,\u201d and \u201c50 cute baby names with holiday meanings.\u201d\n\nWhat this means for you: Think about other ways you can approach trending topics. I like to think of it as \u201ctimely evergreen\u201d content. What information is useful/interesting all of the time but is particularly relevant when certain events happen? For example, holiday content can be republished every year, but also, articles about dating and love are nearly always relevant, but particularly so around Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nFor anything timely, you should be pitching at least a month in advance. Publishers often plan their editorial calendar for major events many weeks out. For example, a regional broadcaster reached out on January 4 asking when we would communicate our coverage plans for the Winter Olympics.\n\nHelp TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.\n\nProvide a recommendation in this quick survey and we\u2019ll share the results with everybody.\n\nWhat this means for you: For any timely pieces, make sure you get them into production at least two months in advance so they\u2019re ready to be pitched/published a month before the relevant event.\n\nPeople want to know about their specific locations. Local community outlets love to feature their cities.\n\nWhat this means for you: Localization is key. If you have data that can be geographically broken down, always provide state- or city-based perspectives in addition to national.\n\nA great example of a piece that\u2019s both timely and localized is a series we did about rural hospital closures in various states across the country.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t tied to a specific event, it\u2019s certainly timely with regard to COVID\u2019s impact on our healthcare system, and it\u2019s an interesting examination of what else has negatively affected healthcare in this country. Each state could run a version of the story that centered their own area.\n\nPromoting newsworthy content\n\nThe two primary ways to promote newsworthy content are to manually pitch it to reporters (the digital PR route) or to build syndication partnerships (like we do).\n\nIn the example story I listed above, we sent the national version of the article out to our newswire, and it was picked up more than 200 times. We also sent out localized versions to various cities featured in the report where their area is centered rather than part of the greater list.\n\nWhether you\u2019re pitching the content or syndicating it, two tenets always apply:\n\nFocus on the publisher\u2019s goals and their audience: Everything you create and send to a publisher should have their needs in mind. What has already performed well on their site? What topics have driven the most engagement? Make it easy: All of our stories are available for free under Creative Commons, and we have a \u201crepublish\u201d button on our site so anyone who wants it can easily syndicate it. The fewer barriers between your content and its publication on another site, the more likely it is to be republished. If you\u2019re pitching, don\u2019t make them email you several times before they see the full project: Provide everything up front.\n\nIncorporating internal linking\n\nMany marketers forget this final step, and it\u2019s a critical one.\n\nWhen you\u2019re earning media, you can\u2019t be putting promotional links in the stories you\u2019re trying to pitch. News sites are understandably not interested in promoting your category or product/service pages.\n\nUsually, they\u2019ll link to your homepage or the page that has the original data/information you shared with them; they do this to cite you as the source of the information they\u2019re sharing. In our case, since publishers are often republishing the stories in full, they also provide a canonical tag, which indicates to Google that our brand partner is the original source of the article.\n\nThese links and canonicals are already a powerful authority signal, but to maximize their effectiveness, consider where you can link to in your original article/report to give other relevant pages a boost. (\u201cRelevant\u201d being the key word here.)\n\nThat\u2019s what internal links are: Links from one of your owned pages to another. Not only does this help Google better understand the content of each of your pages, it also helps distribute authority across your site when you earn authority signals like the ones I\u2019ve referenced in this article.\n\nLet\u2019s say, for example, you work for a pet supplies company and you did a more tangential story about cat adoption statistics. Perhaps you can link from that story to a category page on your site featuring items first-time cat owners should own. Now you\u2019re taking a more general piece and funneling the link equity to a page with more monetary value for your business.\n\nWitnessing organic growth\n\nWhen using this strategy, all kinds of companies, including startups, start seeing organic traffic growth a few months after implementation.\n\nOne of our clients, Sunday Citizen, is a newer brand that came to us to help facilitate their organic growth. After creating eight stories for them, we earned 1,000 quality media pickups (and utilized internal linking from their story pages).\n\nAs a result, we generated a 15x increase in their number of keyword rankings in the top three positions. In under a year, they saw a 5,000% increase in their organic traffic.\n\nThe method isn\u2019t easy, as it involves original content creation and strategic syndication, but the brand authority and growth you can earn are invaluable. It\u2019s the perfect marriage of content and SEO tactics, and if you implement this approach on an ongoing basis, you\u2019re likely to see a steady increase in organic traction in the months and years to come."}
