CEO Kumesh Aroomoogan says that the new capital will be put toward \u201cproduct-led growth,\u201d expansion into new markets and R&D on Accern\u2019s AI technologies.\n\n\u201cMore than 80% of the world\u2019s data is unstructured. Unstructured data requires a hyper-manual process to structure data at scale, consuming expensive data science resources throughout an organization,\u201d Aroomoogan told TechCrunch via email. \u201cDue to the extreme human capital and time costs, unstructured data isn\u2019t efficiently analyzed and is often left out of historical data decisions. The end result affects all organizations\u2019 decision-making capabilities and adds additional risk to their respective portfolios and balance sheets.\u201d\n\nKumesh Aroomoogan, a former research analyst for Wall Street firms including Citigroup, co-founded Accern with Anshul Vikram Pandey in 2014. Originally, New York-based Accern focused on monitoring the web for \u2014 and curating \u2014 a narrow set of financial information, particularly that pertaining to stocks. But the company later broadened its scope to other aspects of corporate finance, like credit and fraud monitoring and compliance.\n\nTo customers, Accern provides AI-powered apps and natural language processing (NLP) models trained to recognize, classify and extract domain-specific financial language. The service can scan public sources, including news publications, blogs and SEC filings, to gauge consumer sentiment, for example, or predict how supply chain disruptions might impact a business.\n\nAccern also offers a visual dashboard users can tap to build custom AI-powered apps as well as pre-built taxonomies that cover companies, people, places and themes. \u201cWe currently have an extensive collection of financial service use cases our customers are building on our platform so they don\u2019t [have to] think about what can be built on our platform or spend time building one from scratch compared to traditional NLP cloud providers,\u201d Aroomoogan said. \u201cAll our models are trained on financial content with assistance from financial analysts and domain experts, which ensures high accuracy for the financial services use cases.\u201d\n\nEven the best-designed algorithms are susceptible to biases or drift, of course, where they dip in accuracy over time due to factors like seasonality and erroneous data. But like many companies whose models are proprietary, Accern is secretive about its development processes. Aroomoogan didn\u2019t reveal when asked which datasets were used to train its models and how the company mitigates any potential biases.\n\nInstead, Aroomoogan \u2014 while refraining from naming customers \u2014 prefers to spotlight Accern\u2019s market traction. While the startup competes with Dataminr and to some extent data analytics products from Noogata and Pecan.ai (plus data services like Reuters and Bloomberg), Aroomoogan claims that Accern\u2019s annual recurring revenue has grown 9x since 2020.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
