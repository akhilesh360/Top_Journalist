The company has picked up $22 million, at a valuation we understand to be in the region of between $100 million and $200 million.\n\nThe list of investors contains some interesting names that speak to strategic potential for Wirepas and its technology. Highland Europe is leading the round, with new backers Amalfi IQT (In-Q-Tel, the investment business connected to the CIA in the U.S.) and previous backers ETF Partners, KPN Ventures (the investment arm of the telecoms giant), Vito Ventures and Vesa Laisi also participating.\n\nThe funding is coming on the heels of some decent traction. Wirepas now has some 160 customers (which it calls \u201cpartners\u201d) and there are 7 million devices connected using its tech. Markets where it operates currently include Australia, Germany, Finland, France, India and the U.S.\n\nSome of the customers include the NHS, which is tracking equipment with its tech and RFID tags; D4 Industry in Turkey using it to track supply chains for steel coils and metal sheets; manufacturer Schaeffler in Finland using the tech to monitor the performance of its machines; and a number of energy utilities using it for smart meters.\n\nThis is, apparently, the tip of the iceberg for what the company\u2019s technology can connect. Mesh, put simply, is a decentralized architecture that essentially treats each device or node on a network as another connectivity access point. So on a wireless network, rather than needing many base stations to be deployed across a space to connect devices, far fewer are required, and unlike the traditional hub and spoke model, it also means better connectivity for the nodes overall.\n\nWirepas says that its system can run as many as 16 million networks, able to handle up to 4 billion devices each. A spinout from the university in Tampere (well known for its contributions to the field of wireless technology), Wirepas says that it has some 100 patents already filed for its approach.\n\nYou might ask yourself the question: Who would need this, and why?\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And, it should be noted, connected devices in total does not not directly translate to how many of those IoT nodes are actually being used.\n\nTeppo Hemi\u00e4, the CEO of Wirepas, said that the company\u2019s big breakthrough was in creating better unit economics by applying mesh architecture and doing away with the need for base stations at all, no matter how advanced they\u2019ve become in 5G or even one day 6G services.\n\n\u201cWhat cellular companies tried to do [in reducing the costs] through smaller cells, we fixed using software,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means you can connect everything to this technology.\u201d\n\nHe believes that the startup has not only figured out a more efficient route, but it\u2019s also worked out a better business model for itself that also changes up and improves IoT unit economics. For starters, the company sells hubs that companies can in turn use to build their own networks as and when they are growing them. That means the costs to provide services are greatly reduced, both for the customer, and for Wirepas itself. The startup in turn provides the inbound connectivity and analytics on the network for measuring usage, security and anything else that the customer is looking to monitor.\n\n\u201cWirepas isn\u2019t just an incremental improvement over existing technologies \u2013 this technology is setting a new standard for what\u2019s possible. By offering a solution that is cost-effective and scalable, Wirepas addresses the two most significant barriers to IoT adoption,\u201d said Laurence Garrett, a partner at Highland Europe, in a statement."}
