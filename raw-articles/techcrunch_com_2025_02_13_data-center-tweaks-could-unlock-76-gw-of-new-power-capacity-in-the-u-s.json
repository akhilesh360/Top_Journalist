That\u2019s more than all data centers use globally, according to Goldman Sachs. To put that number into perspective, it\u2019s about 10% of peak demand in the U.S.\n\nIf data centers were to curtail their use more, they could unlock progressively more capacity.\n\nSuch programs aren\u2019t exactly new.\n\nFor decades, utilities have encouraged big electricity users like shopping malls, universities, and factories to curtail their use when demand peaks, like on hot summer days. Those users might turn down the air conditioning or turn off thirsty machines for a few hours, and in return, the utility gives them a credit on their bill.\n\nData centers have largely sat on the sidelines, instead opting to maintain uptime and performance levels for their customers. The study argues that data centers could be ideal demand-response participants because they have the potential to be flexible.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

One is temporal flexibility, or shifting computing tasks to times of lower demand. AI model training, for example, could easily be rescheduled to accommodate a brief curtailment.\n\nAnother is spatial flexibility, where companies shift their computational tasks to other regions that aren\u2019t experiencing high demand. Even with data centers, operators can consolidate loads and shut down a portion of their servers.\n\nAnd if tasks are mission critical and can\u2019t be delayed or shifted, data center operators can always turn to alternative power sources to make up for any curtailment. Batteries are ideally suited for this since even modestly sized installations can provide several hours of power almost instantaneously.\n\nSome companies have already participated in ad hoc versions of these.\n\nGoogle has used its carbon-aware computing platform, originally developed to trim emissions, to enable demand response. Enel X has worked with data centers to tap into the batteries in their uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to stabilize the grid. And PG&E is offering to connect data centers to the grid quicker if operators agree to participate in a demand response program.\n\nThese tweaks won\u2019t completely eliminate the need for new sources of power. But they might turn a potentially catastrophic situation \u2014 in which half of all new AI servers are underpowered \u2014 into one that\u2019s more easily solved."}
