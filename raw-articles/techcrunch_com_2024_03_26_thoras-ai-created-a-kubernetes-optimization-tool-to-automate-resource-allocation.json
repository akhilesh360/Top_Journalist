Eventually they ended up immigrating to the U.S. and settling in northern Virginia, where they gave birth to twin girls, who would both grow up to become engineers and work for Slack and the DoD respectively, helping implement cloud-native solutions.\n\nIn their previous jobs, the Rahmani sisters recognized a problem with how engineers sourced Kubernetes workloads, relying too much on intuition and not enough on data. Having inherited some of their parents\u2019 bravery, they decided to leave their comfortable jobs and launch Thoras.ai to solve the problem.\n\nToday, the company announced a $1.5 million pre-seed investment.\n\n\u201cThoras essentially integrates alongside a cloud-based service and it consistently monitors the usage of that service,\u201d company CEO Nilo Rahmani told TechCrunch. \u201cSo the goal is to not only forecast demand, but then to autonomously scale the application up or down in anticipation of increased traffic or decreased traffic.\u201d It also has the ability to notify an engineer of a performance issue with the goal that they understand that there\u2019s a problem before it blows up into something more serious.\n\nThey launched the company right after the first of the year and closed their pre-seed funding just a few weeks ago. They have already released the first version of the product and are working in live customer environments and generating revenue, all positive signs for an early-stage startup like this one.\n\nWhile the founders didn\u2019t want to get into too much detail about what\u2019s happening on the back end, the application connects directly to the company\u2019s development environment with no APIs involved, and no information traveling back and forth, as security and privacy was a key design factor for them. Developers see a dashboard with key information about the application\u2019s resources, and Nilo says they spent a lot of time making sure they provided a visually appealing user experience in the dashboard.\n\nIn terms of AI, the company currently uses more task-based machine learning than generative AI and large language models (LLMs). \u201cA lot of the problems that we\u2019re facing are systemic issues, and there are a lot of numbers involved. And so traditional machine learning and AI can be used to forecast what consumption looks like,\u201d she said. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t foresee using LLMs down the road, but for now they want to be more proactive looking for potential problems. They see LLMs being more useful in troubleshooting after the fact at some point as they fill out the product.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

I talk about that all the time,\u201d Nilo said. Jennifer added, \u201cIt definitely helps drive us to work as hard as we can and succeed, I would say.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s pre-seed investment was co-led by Storytime Capital and Focal VC with participation from Hustle Fund, Precursor Ventures, the Pitch Fund and several unnamed strategic angel investors."}
