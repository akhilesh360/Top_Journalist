Using Quantinuum\u2019s ion-trap hardware and Microsoft\u2019s new qubit-virtualization system, the team was able to run more than 14,000 experiments without a single error. This new system also allowed the team to check the logical qubits and correct any errors it encountered without destroying the logical qubits.\n\nThis, the two companies say, has now moved the state-of-the-art of quantum computing out of what has typically been dubbed the era of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers. \u201cNoisy\u201d because even the smallest changes in the environment can lead a quantum system to essentially become random (or \u201cdecohere\u201d), and \u201cintermediate scale\u201d because the current generation of quantum computers is still limited to just over a thousand qubits at best. A qubit is the fundamental unit of computing in quantum systems, analogous to a bit in a classic computer, but each qubit can be in multiple states at the same time and doesn\u2019t fall into a specific position until measured, which underlies the potential of quantum to deliver a huge leap in computing power.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many qubits you have, though, if you barely have time to run a basic algorithm before the system becomes too noisy to get a useful result \u2014 or any result at all.\n\nCombining several different techniques, the team was able to run thousands of experiments with virtually no errors. That involved quite a bit of preparation and pre-selecting systems that already looked to be in good shape for a successful run, but still, that\u2019s a massive improvement from where the industry was just a short while ago.\n\nIt\u2019s a step in the right direction for quantum computing. There are still plenty of problems to be solved (and these results need to be replicated, too, of course), but theoretically, a computer with 100 of these logical qubits could already be useful for solving some problems, while a machine with 1,000 qubits could, Microsoft says, \u201cunlock commercial advantage.\u201d\n\nThe team used Quantinuum\u2019s H2 trapped-ion processor and was able to combine 30 physical qubits into four highly reliable logical qubits. Encoding multiple physical qubits into a single logical qubit helps protect the system from errors. The physical qubits are entangled together so that it becomes possible to detect an error in a physical qubit and fix it.\n\nIt\u2019s this error correction that has long vexed the industry: The lower the noise and the higher the quality of the physical qubits, the better, of course, but without sophisticated error correction, there is no way out of the NISQ era because these systems will all decohere sooner rather than later.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Now, Microsoft and Quantinuum argue that their new hardware/software system demonstrates the largest gap between physical and logical error rates, improving on using only physical qubits by up to 800x.\n\nThe researchers note that to move beyond NISQ, a large separation between logical and physical qubit error rates is necessary, as is the ability to correct individual circuit errors and to generate entanglement between at least two logical qubits. If these results hold up, then the team achieved all three and we have indeed entered a stable era the era of resilient quantum computing.\n\nAs it turns out, the most important result here may actually be the team\u2019s ability to perform \u201cactive syndrome extraction\u201d \u2014 that is, the ability to diagnose an error and correct it, without destroying the logical qubit in the process.\n\n\u201cThis achievement marks the first step in being able to correct errors while not destroying the logical qubits and showcases a fundamental milestone in quantum error correction,\u201d Tom and Svore explain. \u201cWe demonstrated this critical component of reliable quantum computing with our qubit-virtualization system, which resulted in a low logical error rate over multiple rounds of syndrome extraction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll now be up to the rest of the quantum community to replicate these results and implement similar error correction systems. That\u2019s likely just a matter of time, though.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s results mark a historic achievement and are a wonderful reflection of how this collaboration continues to push the boundaries for the quantum ecosystem,\u201d said Ilyas Khan, founder and chief product officer of Quantinuum. \u201cWith Microsoft\u2019s state-of-the-art error correction aligned with the world\u2019s most powerful quantum computer and a fully integrated approach, we are so excited for the next evolution in quantum applications and can\u2019t wait to see how our customers and partners will benefit from our solutions especially as we move towards quantum processors at scale.\u201d\n\nFor more details, you can find the technical paper here."}
