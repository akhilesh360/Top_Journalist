According to the lab, Gemini Robotics was trained to generalize behavior across a range of different robotics hardware, and to connect items robots can \u201csee\u201d with actions they might take.\n\nDeepMind claims that in tests, Gemini Robotics allowed robots to perform well in environments not included in the training data. The lab has released a slimmed-down model, Gemini Robotics-ER, that researchers can use to train their own models for robotics control, as well as a benchmark called Asimov for gauging risks with AI-powered robots."}
