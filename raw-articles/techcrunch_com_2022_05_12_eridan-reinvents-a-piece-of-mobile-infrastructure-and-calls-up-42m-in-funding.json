But it won\u2019t surprise many to hear that, as is often the case with infrastructure, some pieces are the latest tech and others haven\u2019t changed in decades. Eridan is a well-funded startup aiming to replace one of the latter with fundamentally different hardware approach could make mobile networks an order of magnitude more efficient.\n\nEverywhere you look \u2014 or more likely, just above where you look \u2014 there are cell towers that connect your phone to the broader internet. You can think of these as being made up of three big pieces: the modem, which exchanges data with the rest of the net; the antenna, which beams out the radio signal in synchrony with dozens or hundreds of devices nearby; and the transceiver, which sits in between and converts the digital data of the modem to the actual RF signal the antenna puts out.\n\nObviously the modem must change with the times and increase capacity, and it has done so. Likewise the antenna must change to reflect new and repurposed slices of spectrum being used for mobile data. But the transceiver is sort of like a digital-to-analog converter in that its job hasn\u2019t really changed much \u2014 data in, signal out.\n\nRecently, however, we have begun to probe the limits of that middle bit, which is a dinosaur in technological terms.\n\n\u201cHow that transceiver has powered the antenna hasn\u2019t changed in the last 70 years,\u201d said Eridan co-founder Doug Kirkpatrick. \u201cIt\u2019s called a linear amplifier, and that device, that circuit architecture approach is literally at the limit with what 5G is today.\u201d\n\nThese amplifiers are essentially analog devices, and due to their fundamental nature, the more power you put into them, the less efficient they are. And over the years the power used has only increased as the number and complexity of signals has grown; 5G transceivers are roughly half as efficient as 4G ones, which were half as efficient as 3G \u2014 yet due to spectrum limitations and growing demand, we\u2019ll need far more 5G cells. Even if the difference is only a handful of watts, it adds up very quickly if you plan to cover all populated areas plus highways.\n\n\u201cIf you want to get everywhere, it\u2019s like 20 times more radios, and with the efficiency going down too, you\u2019re talking about taking up 50% of the U.S.\u2019s electricity,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cThis dog don\u2019t hunt.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

If you want everyone to have 5G without melting the planet, we are the absolute only way this happens,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnd just what is it exactly that Eridan has done? I hinted at my skepticism that a startup with limited means could leapfrog decades of research by some of the richest companies on the planet.\n\n\u201cWell, we cheated,\u201d Kirkpatrick admitted. One of the founders of the company, Earl McCune, who sadly passed away two years ago during the development process, was among those doing the research at those big telecoms, where his approach never took off. Not to say he took trade secrets with him, of course \u2014 they just found a way to make the theory reality outside of the corporate structure.\n\nAfter meeting during a failed recruitment to do related work for a large company, the founders decided they liked each other enough to pursue the concept independently.\n\n\u201cWe did what you\u2019d do, sat down with a bar napkin and a beer,\u201d he recalled, and after filling the think tanks a bit, \u201cIt was one of those epiphanies. Everybody\u2019s eyebrows went up and they said, \u2018that\u2019s an insane idea \u2026 but it might work.\u2019 Then literally the first time we turned it on, it was the most perfect signal you\u2019ve ever seen. We said, \u2018how the hell are we going to explain this to anybody?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe advance is in some ways a simple one, like going from vacuum tubes to transistors.\n\n\u201cA linear amplifier is an analog amplifier; since they\u2019re worrying about cost and efficiency, they\u2019ve made the best of a bad bargain: how dirty [i.e., how noisy] can you make the signal and still be efficient? This is fundamental to what linear amplifiers do,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re a digital switch \u2014 we send out an ultra-clean signal. It\u2019s a hundred times smaller and a hundred times cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis type of direct polar architecture, Earl wrote books on it \u2014 he was a savant of this kind of approach,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. His other co-founder, Dubravko Babi\u00e7, is a materials expert who focuses on gallium nitride, which without delving too far into the details is used in combination with silicon to create high-efficiency chip architectures. The GaN-silicon combo here let them make a jump from around 10% efficiency in installed devices to 50%.\n\nThey first collected a $5 million contract from DARPA, thinking it could be used to shrink military radios, but soon realized the tech reached well beyond the defense category and brought it to telecoms.\n\nThe resulting \u201cMiracle\u201d device (which just looks like a normal PCB, by the way) is so dissimilar to existing infrastructure that they\u2019ve had trouble getting prospective companies to understand its qualities. \u201cBut a little over a year ago the doubters got everything they needed \u2014 we demoed it on top of a mast. You can doubt the tech all you want, but when you light it up on a mast it\u2019s game over,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.\n\nStill, he admitted, the infrastructure market is conservative. These are companies paying huge sums to build millions of installations to serve hundreds of millions of people \u2014 they tend to go with what they know works even if there\u2019s a newcomer out there that\u2019s better and cheaper. But a pilot test at Fort Hood should show off Eridan\u2019s 5G small cell capabilities, which assuming all goes well should lead into commercial deployments around the end of 2023.\n\nWhat likely convinced them, beyond the existential threat of linear amps reaching the theoretical limits of the amount of data they can handle, is the further expandability of Eridan\u2019s tech. It would be enough to make 5G deployments cheaper and better \u2014 but what about the next upgrade?\n\nThe latest signal protocols coming from mobile data authorities and standard setters involve 8-bit signals pushing 256 QAM \u2014 we won\u2019t get into the technical details here either but you can think of it as equivalent to home internet bandwidth. Essentially the more bits you can fit in a given stretch of signal, the more data you can deliver, though as is always the case with wireless, the more risk there is that this increasingly complex and fragile signal doesn\u2019t arrive intact.\n\nAs you can imagine, going from analog to digital production of that signal has a huge effect on how effective a transmission is. \u201cWhich do you think propagates farther, a clean signal or a dirty signal?\u201d asked Kirkpatrick, obviously rhetorically. The use of GaN allows the system to operate at high voltages, removing the need for an amplifier at all, further improving signal because amplifiers amplify \u201cthe crud along with the good\u201d in a dirty signal.\n\nEridan had an experimental 10-bit, 1,024-QAM released by 3GPP working within hours of its release and has moved on to showing in a lab setting that they can transmit a 16-bit, 64K (i.e., 65,536)-QAM signal. (Trust that people who like wireless protocols will find that number very impressive.)\n\nThe promise of being a major part of infrastructure that needs to be built out for a decade and more has clearly activated the check-writing portions of investors\u2019 brains. After the $5 million from DARPA, Eridan has raised a total of $46 million between today\u2019s B round announcement and a secret $8 million A round. The latest round was led by Capricorn Investment Group, Monta Vista Capital and Social Capital (which led the A round).\n\nThe money will go toward hiring up and manufacturing \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re setting up to make tens or hundreds of millions of these things,\u201d said Kirkpatrick. Though he couldn\u2019t name the prospective customers, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the likes of whom would benefit from this hardware. Basically, if you\u2019ve heard them hollering about 5G at some point in the last five years, they\u2019re probably on the list.\n\nCommercial deployments should start appearing after the official demonstrations at Ft Hood and elsewhere next year. You probably won\u2019t notice anything \u2014 but then again, that\u2019s kind of the point."}
