It previously gained attention for a 2022 Haaretz article detailing its claims about being able to obtain and even delete security camera footage.\n\nThe company is now looking to hire a \u201cClient Director USA\u201d to \u201csupport new business growth within the US government market.\u201d The position requires a \u201cstrong history of technology sales within DoD and national security agencies.\u201d\n\nToka is also seeking a customer success engineer under its North America team that is responsible for helping its clients with \u201cdeployment, training, and enablement.\u201d Experience working with federal law enforcement is considered an advantage.\n\nToka told TechCrunch it is \u201cmostly filling open slots\u201d and declined to comment further on its U.S. government activities.\n\n\u201cWhat we can say is that Toka only sells to militaries, homeland security organizations, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies in the United States and its closest allies who use our products in compliance with local laws,\u201d a company spokesman said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Hezbollah warned Lebanese residents earlier this year to turn off their security cameras to prevent Israel from hacking into them to spot targets.\n\nBut this kind of tech doesn\u2019t have to be limited to war zones. TechCrunch reported last month that a16z\u2019s Ben Horowitz tried to donate funds to the Las Vegas Police Department for purchasing Toka software. They didn\u2019t take him up on it, a Toka spokesman said.\n\nToka has publicly raised $37.5 million since its founding in 2018 from investors like a16z, Dell Capital, and others. Haaretz previously reported in 2022 that Toka was seeking to work with U.S. Special Forces and an unnamed U.S. intelligence agency.\n\nToka has sought to avoid scrutiny on Israeli spyware outfits like the U.S.-sanctioned NSO Group, publicly promising that it only does business with governments from a \u201cselect list of countries\u201d with good track records on civil liberties and corruption.\n\nToka is listed as attending a conference in the UAE in 2021 and earlier this year hired a vice president of international sales who previously worked for Cellebrite, another controversial Israeli cyber firm. But Toka told TechCrunch it doesn\u2019t have any clients in the UAE and monitors its international sales closely.\n\n\u201cWe regularly review this select list of countries, using outside assessments on a range of issues, including civil liberties, rule of law, and corruption,\u201d Toka\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cAssisting us in this process are two distinguished outside advisers: Professor Peter Schuck of Yale Law School and Israel Prize-winner Jacob Frenkel, currently Chairman of JP Morgan Chase International and a former IMF official.\u201d"}
