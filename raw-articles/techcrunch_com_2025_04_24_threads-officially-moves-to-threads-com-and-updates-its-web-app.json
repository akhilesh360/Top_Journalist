The transition will coincide with a handful of quality-of-life improvements for the Threads web app, including features to more easily access custom feeds, saved posts, and likes, as well as other tools for creating new columns, copying posts for resharing, finding your favorite creators from X on Threads, and more.\n\nMeta had initially launched its new social app in July 2023 on the URL Threads.net, as a Sequoia-backed Slack alternative startup had owned the Threads.com domain at the time. (That startup sold to Shopify last year.)\n\nIn September 2024, Meta acquired the Threads.com domain name and later began redirecting the URL Threads.com to Threads.net.\n\nStarting today, Meta explains that users will no longer be redirected from the .com to the .net; it will be the other way around.\n\nGoing forward, if you type in Threads.com in your browser, you\u2019ll go directly to your Threads home screen without being redirected. Meanwhile, those who type in Threads.net will be redirected to the URL Threads.com.\n\nThe change gives Meta a more prominent and better-remembered URL for its social app that now reaches over 320 million monthly active users, as of Meta\u2019s last public earnings announcement in January. The rebrand of sorts may allow the app to better compete with its rival X, which also has a memorable (and simple!) domain name.\n\nIn addition to this change, Instagram head Adam Mosseri on Thursday announced a few other minor updates coming to the Threads web app, which is often used by creators.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This will make it easier to share Threads posts in other apps, like Instagram, Meta thinks.\n\nThreads users will also now be able to add a column by clicking a new column icon on the right side of the screen.\n\nImage Credits:Threads\n\nAnd they\u2019ll be able to click a plus \u201c+\u201d button in the bottom right to open a new window and compose a post.\n\nImage Credits:Threads\n\nThere\u2019s also a new feature that allows people to find and follow the same creators they previously followed on X. This feature was introduced earlier this month and works by having users download an archive of their X data, which is uploaded to Threads.\n\nThose who previously had access to the feature were shown a pop-up saying they could now \u201cFind popular creators from X.\u201d The feature remains in testing, Meta says."}
