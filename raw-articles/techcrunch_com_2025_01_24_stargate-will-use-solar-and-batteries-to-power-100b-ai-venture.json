Stargate is a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Group, which promises to build a slew of new data centers to drive artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThe growth in cloud computing and AI in recent years has sent developers and tech companies scurrying to secure power. The U.S. Department of Energy expects that data centers could consume as much as 12% of all power produced in the U.S. by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023. The looming crunch could leave 50% of new data centers underpowered by 2027.\n\nNuclear power has emerged as a darling of data center developers and tech companies. Google signed a 500-megawatt deal with nuclear startup Kairos, and Microsoft is restarting one of the shuttered reactors at Three Mile Island. Data center operator Switch announced an agreement in December with Oklo, the Sam Altman-backed small modular reactor company, for 12 gigawatts of capacity.\n\nBut nuclear\u2019s recent history has been beset by cost overruns and delays. The fresh crop of nuclear startups were largely founded to overcome those hurdles by modularizing and mass-producing reactor components. If all goes as planned, the approach could speed approvals and construction of new nuclear plants.\n\nBut despite progress, none of the startups has yet to complete a reactor, and the first of their commercial reactors aren\u2019t expected to come online until 2030, doing little to ease the near-term energy shortage. Natural gas power plants, another possible source for data centers, will also take years to build.\n\nSolar and wind farms are much quicker to stand up. Compared with nuclear and natural gas plants, they can be completed in about half the time, according to one study of 50 years\u2019 worth of power plant projects. More recent estimates suggest that the average time to completion for a solar power plant is around 18 months. Because of their inherent modularity, they can start producing power before the bulk of the project is complete.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For data centers, grid connections can be optional \u2014 many could take power directly from the source. And given the apparent urgency of Stargate, it\u2019s possible that permitting could be sped along, too, leaving solar as the likely frontrunner for the first data centers.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!
