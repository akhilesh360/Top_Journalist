OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that Caitlin Kalinowski will be joining the startup.\n\nKalinowski is a hardware executive who began leading Meta\u2019s AR glasses team in March 2022. She oversaw the creation of Orion, the impressive augmented reality prototype that Meta recently showed off at its annual Connect conference. Kalinowski also led the hardware team behind Meta\u2019s virtual reality goggles for roughly nine years. Before that, she worked at Apple, designing the hardware for MacBooks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to share that I\u2019m joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware,\u201d said Kalinowski in her post. \u201cIn my new role, I will initially focus on OpenAI\u2019s robotics work and partnerships to help bring AI into the physical world and unlock its benefits for humanity.\u201d\n\nPossibly, Kalinowski will work with her old boss Jony Ive, a former Apple executive, on a new AI hardware device that OpenAI and Ive\u2019s startup, LoveFrom, are building together. In September, Ive confirmed he was building a hardware product with OpenAI, describing it as \u201ca product that uses AI to create a computing experience that is less socially disruptive than the iPhone.\u201d\n\nOpenAI also recently started hiring research engineers for a robotics team that\u2019s aimed at helping OpenAI\u2019s partners incorporate its multimodal AI into their hardware. The reboot of OpenAI\u2019s robotics team comes roughly four years after the startup disbanded its hardware research to focus its efforts on software. In 2018, OpenAI built a robot hand that could learn how to grip objects all on its own.\n\nSeveral companies already are incorporating OpenAI\u2019s models into their hardware. The most obvious is Apple, which will launch its ChatGPT integration for the iPhone later this year. Another is the robotics company Figure, whose humanoid 01 robot leverages OpenAI\u2019s software for natural speech conversations."}
