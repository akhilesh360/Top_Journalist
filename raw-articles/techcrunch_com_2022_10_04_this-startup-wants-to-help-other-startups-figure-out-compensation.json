Startups, in particular, struggle with compensation as they are often competing with other startups for talent.\n\nFor Roger Lee, the issue came up repeatedly when he co-founded 401(k) provider Human Interest, which achieved unicorn status in August of 2021 and today has nearly 700 employees. (Lee is no longer involved in that company\u2019s day-to-day operations, although he remains on its board.)\n\n\u201cFiguring out employee compensation was one of our top sources of frustration,\u201d Lee told TechCrunch. \u201cWe were using what felt like 1,000 spreadsheets to track and decide salaries, equity, raises, pay ranges and offers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was impossible to get a holistic view of employee compensation to ensure that we were paying people fairly and competitively.\u201d\n\nSo in October of 2021, he teamed up with his former Harvard roommate Teddy Sherrill to start Comprehensive in an effort to tackle the problem. The company is emerging from stealth today, announcing a $6 million seed round raised earlier this year led by Inspired Capital and including participation from Floodgate, SV Angel as well as founders and C-level executives of Rippling, Wealthfront, Pilot.com, Thumbtack, Public.com and others.\n\nComprehensive\u2019s target customers are startups, a world Lee is familiar with, having started two of his own, as well as launching Layoffs.FYI \u2014 a layoff tracker \u2014 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early customers include Mercury, LaunchDarkly, Clearbit, Titan and Clever.\n\nA number of startups have emerged in this space in recent years. In August, Complete announced a $4 million raise. As TC\u2019s Anita Ramaswamy wrote at that time, \u201cSeries A startup OpenComp has a similar product geared toward high-growth companies looking to improve their recruitment and retention, while\u2026YC-backed Compound seeks to help tech employees understand their own compensation.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For example, it wants to help startups with all aspects of compensation matters within their organization \u2014 going beyond salaries to also advise on compensation reviews, employee communication and pay analytics.\n\n\u201cEmployee compensation is now more complex and higher-stakes than ever, given the recent trends of remote work and inflation and the focus on DE& I,\u201d said Lee.\n\nHe argues that the issue goes beyond human resources with multiple teams involved in the process and data scattered across multiple systems. Lee is hoping with Comprehensive, companies will \u201chave the visibility to see the compensation-related information in a single place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen comp data lives in siloed systems, a company can\u2019t really make informed decisions on compensation,\u201d Lee added. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to unify all that data.\u201d\n\nComprehensive is not just about employee recruitment, he emphasizes. It\u2019s also about employee retention. Lee estimates that employee compensation typically represents 70-80% of startups\u2019 overall costs \u2014 representing its biggest expense \u201cby far.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, startups want to know that the money they\u2019re spending is being used to reward and retain their high performers and not being wasted,\u201d Lee said.\n\nComprehensive operates a SaaS model where it charges companies a subscription based on their size. The 10-person startup plans to use its capital toward growth and continued hiring.\n\nAlexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital, believes that as the HR tech stack \u201ccontinues to shift to the cloud, compensation is a thorny and complex tech challenge that is ripe for innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompensation has fundamentally evolved in the past year, and Comprehensive was born to meet this specific moment: more remote companies with disparate compensation expectations, salary inflation, increased needs for compensation disclosure and assessments for pay gaps, and more,\u201d von Tobel wrote via email.\n\nMy weekly fintech newsletter, The Interchange, launched on May 1!
