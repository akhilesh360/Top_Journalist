Somebody needed to come into that space to think about how to solve these operational challenges, build the logistics, technology, and the infrastructure to support the idea of at-home lab testing.\u201d\n\nHealthtracka\u2019s offering is a website where individuals can book their lab tests online, have their samples collected at home and get their results via email within 48 hours. The tests range from fertility and STD tests to full body count and COVID tests.\n\nThe one-year-old health tech company focuses on preventive care and partners with lab centers \u2014 which send their phlebotomists to customers\u2019 homes \u2014 to diagnose. Dare-Johnson said the team\u2019s experience in the diagnostic field helps it create quality checklists to vet these lab centers, one of which is meeting the standard ISO laboratory accreditation.\n\nHealthtracka also works with doctors to review results and specialists for further consultation. But while a typical test covers phlebotomists\u2019 trips and doctors\u2019 reviewing results, customers pay extra when Healthtracka connects them with specialists if the diagnosis is worrying.\n\n\u201cIf you do your full-body checkup with us, and there are indicators that show you need to pay attention to some of your markers, which our internal doctors cater to,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cBut if they feel you need to seek a specialist opinion on the result\u2019s marker, then we refer you to a specialist.\u201d\n\nHealthtracka\u2019s network of phlebotomists has increased 20x since its launch to over 100. And according to Dare-Johnson, the company has delivered close to 7,000 tests at home. Its revenue is growing 30% month on month as a result.\n\nThe company is taking three approaches to pursue more growth and diversify its revenue streams. First, it is launching subscription plans for its retail customers. The second is betting on its B2B play: offering APIs for telehealth service providers, hospitals and pharmacies to provide at-home blood testing for their patients. Third, the health tech company is looking to extend its presence beyond seven Nigerian cities to Kenya and Ghana before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOur progress has moved from being B2C to an infrastructure play, somehow. We want to power digital diagnostics and empower healthcare providers to reach their customers where they are comfortable,\u201d the chief executive said. \u201cThis will help reach more people, save more lives and ensure that healthcare is better in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe funding will assist Healthtracka in its next growth phase as it also scales its B2B2C offering where partner companies in Nigeria can deliver at-home testing to their employees.\n\nInvestors in this round include Africa-focused early-stage VC Ingressive Capital and U.S.-based venture fund Hustle Fund. Angel investors included Alumni Angel Alliance and Flying Doctors.\n\n\u201cIfeoluwa is hungry and very bright. Not only did we anonymously use Healthtracka\u2019s services in diligence and have a 10/10 experience, we recognized truly what this could become across the continent, even from just interacting with her team for tests,\u201d said Maya Horgan Famodu, founder of Ingressive Capital on the raise. \u201cThe product is high quality, on time, affordable and unlocking the door for a healthier Africa.\u201d\n\nAfrican health and biotech companies raised $392 million in funding in 2021; less than $2 million was raised by female health tech founders. Healthtracka joins a very brief list that includes the likes of French and Ivorian-based Susu and Nigerian-based Medsaf as one of the few health tech venture-backed startups with indigenous female CEOs to have raised over $1 million in a single round.\n\nA common theme among some of Healthtracka\u2019s investors \u2014 Ingressive, Hustle and Flying Doctors, including FirstCheck Africa, one of the startup\u2019s first backers \u2014 is that they are female-led. Venture rounds such as this are a testament to the fact that women investors are walking the walk and collectively improving access to capital for women founders."}
