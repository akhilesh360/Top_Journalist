Vogt did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe fresh round of funding comes less than a year since Vogt launched The Bot Company, which is aiming to produce a robot focused on household chores. The company launched in May with $150 million from former GitHub CEO and investor Nat Friedman, Pioneer founder and investor Daniel Gross, Spark Capital general partner Nabeel Hyatt, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, Stripe co-founder John Collison, and Quiet Capital.\n\nThe new startup was launched about five months after Vogt resigned as CEO of Cruise, the autonomous vehicle startup that he founded in 2013 and was later acquired by General Motors. His resignation followed an October 2 incident that saw a Cruise vehicle run over and drag a pedestrian 20 feet, after the pedestrian had been hit by a human-driven car."}
