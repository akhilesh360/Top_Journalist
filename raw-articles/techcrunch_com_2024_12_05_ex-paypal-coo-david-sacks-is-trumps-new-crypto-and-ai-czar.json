He\u2019s also behind Craft Ventures, a VC fund that has backed startups, including SpaceX, Reddit, and ClickUp.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC in 2017, Sacks said he believed that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum fulfill the \u201coriginal vision\u201d of PayPal: creating a \u201cdatabase of money\u201d in which payments never leave the system.\n\nSacks\u2019 views on AI and AI policymaking are less obvious, though his policies generally are decidedly right-leaning and deregulatory, which could well mean a lighter touch than the outgoing Biden administration favored.\n\n"}
