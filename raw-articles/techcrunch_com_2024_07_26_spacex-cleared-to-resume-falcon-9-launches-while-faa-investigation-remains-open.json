This course of action is standard after a rocket launch goes wrong.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 experienced a rare issue on orbit after a routine launch of a batch of Starlink satellites on July 11. While launch and stage separation proceeded as expected, the second stage experienced a catastrophic issue. Twenty satellites were deployed, but were in an orbit too low to survive. All of the satellites have reentered the atmosphere and burned up.\n\nLate Thursday, SpaceX confirmed in an update posted to its website that the problem was due to a liquid oxygen leak in the insulation surrounding the second stage\u2019s single Merlin engine. That leak was due to a crack in a sensing line connected to the pressure sensor, which developed due to a loose clamp in the line and the strain from engine vibration.\n\nDespite the leak, which occurred during the first firing of the second stage engine on orbit, the mission continued to proceed as normal. But the liquid oxygen made the engine components ultra-cold; as a result, the second attempted firing did not go to plan. Instead of a controlled burn, the engine \u201cexperienced a hard start,\u201d SpaceX said, which damaged the engine and caused the upper stage to lose its orientation on orbit.\n\nSpaceX has removed the failed sense line and sensor on the second stage engine for near-term Falcon 9 launches, which are not used in the flight safety system, the company said. The company has already tested the design change at its rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas. The company also conducted additional inspections of all sense lines on its active second stage fleet, leading to \u201cproactive replacement\u201d in some instances, SpaceX added in its update.\n\nPrior to this issue, SpaceX boasted a 335-launch streak across its Falcon family of rockets. That includes 96 successful launches in 2023 and 69 successful launches this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That launch will carry another batch of Starlink satellites to orbit."}
