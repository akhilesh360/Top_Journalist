It\u2019s already overfull with platforms recording, analyzing and acting on data from temperature, motion and other sensors along those lines in buildings, warehouses and factories. Companies like Dabbel are attempting to automate HVAC controls in commercial buildings to cut CO2, while startups such as Traction and Augury offer products that plug into existing machinery to predict wear and tear. Amazon\u2019s even thrown its hat in the ring with Lookout for Equipment, launched in April, which ingests sensor data from industrial equipment and then trains an algorithm to anticipate machine failure.\n\nDespite the crowdedness in the industrial IoT sector, Vatsal Shah argues that there\u2019s room for one more competitor. He\u2019s somewhat biased in this belief given that he\u2019s the co-founder of Litmus Automation, which helps manufacturers collect edge device data so they can use it for applications such as AI. But proving his point somewhat, Litmus today closed a $30 million Series B funding round led by industrial automation company Belden, $20 million of which came from Belden and $10 million of which was furnished by a \u201clarge strategic\u201d investor that Shah wouldn\u2019t reveal by name.\n\nThe fresh capital brings Litmus\u2019s total raised to $42.6 million to date.\n\n\u201cThe idea for Litmus came to me based on my experience at Rockwell Automation as an industrial design engineer,\u201d Shah told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cI was working on one of the largest oil and gas pipeline projects in the world, where collecting pipeline data from heterogenous industrial systems and storing it in a simple database took over six months of development. I realized these complexities were only going to increase with the growing data siloes and the introduction of many more connected devices.\u201d\n\nAfter recruiting Purdue classmate John Younes as a co-founder, who in turn brought on longtime friend Sacha Sawaya, Shah launched Litmus in 2014.\n\n\u201cI identified the need for a platform to seamlessly collect data from many different types of industrial systems and devices to make it available to third-party applications efficiently and with intelligence in between,\u201d Shah continued. \u201cThe biggest challenge enterprise companies face is access to the data they need to fuel machine learning and AI models. This is something Litmus specializes in.\u201d\n\nTo this end, Litmus can collect data to feed AI and machine learning models and then run those models at the \u201cedge\u201d (e.g., a warehouse or manufacturing plant). For example, one customer, Taiwan-based Chimei, uses Litmus to run multiple AI models on the same edge device, store data at the edge, run analytics, visualize data and send data to existing enterprise storage systems and apps.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Last year certainly set the stage, when VCs poured more than $1.4 billion into the industrial IoT space, according to Crunchbase \u2014 up from $1.7 billion in 2020.\n\nShah says the majority of the Series B tranche will go toward expanding 75-employee Litmus\u2019s go-to-market efforts and \u201cscaling to support enterprise customers globally.\u201d"}
