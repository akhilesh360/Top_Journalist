Sling TV also allows users to expand to full screen to have a more immersive playing experience. Meanwhile, Netflix\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s gaming offerings are only for paid subscribers.\n\nSling TV says that 10 games will be available at launch. New titles are to be added every few months, including Astroids and other titles, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. Sling will also introduce new games before big events like football season.\n\nThe current game selection is thanks to Sling\u2019s partnership with Play.Works, a connected-TV games provider that distributes games on more than 200 million televisions, and has teamed up with various major TV companies like Comcast, Cox, Samsung, Vizio and more. Sling didn\u2019t say if it would partner with other gaming companies to expand its gaming library, but we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it did. There\u2019s also a possibility that Sling acquires independent studios and developers. When Netflix launched games in 2021, the streaming giant went on a buying spree as part of its gaming push, acquiring six companies to help build out its collection of titles.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring all possibilities to bring our customers the broadest game catalog and the best gaming experience possible,\u201d the spokesperson told us.\n\nArcade is currently only on Amazon Fire TV and Android TV. Sling is adding support for more devices in the next month, including most smart TVs. However, the spokesperson said the company couldn\u2019t share a specific date for when it\u2019ll be available for Apple TV and Roku.\n\nIn recent years, Sling has struggled to keep subscribers, but Arcade could set the streamer apart from competitors as it offers unique and interactive entertainment for users. Dish, which recently merged with EchoStar, reported a loss of 65,000 Sling TV subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2023, bringing the total to 2.06 million. It lost 77,000 subs in the same period a year prior.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
