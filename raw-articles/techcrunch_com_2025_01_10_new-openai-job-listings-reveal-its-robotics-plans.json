Then, it brought it back. Now, through a social media post from its hardware director and newly published job descriptions, OpenAI is revealing more about its plans for the revived team.\n\nIn a post on X on Friday, Caitlin Kalinowski, who joined OpenAI to lead hardware last November from Meta\u2019s AR glasses division, said that OpenAI will develop its own robots \u2014 complete with a custom sensor suite.\n\nIn the post, Kalinowski spotlighted new OpenAI robotics job listings with additional info.\n\nPer the listings, OpenAI\u2019s robotics team will focus on \u201cgeneral-purpose,\u201d \u201cadaptive,\u201d and \u201cversatile\u201d robots that can operate with human-like intelligence in \u201cdynamic,\u201d \u201creal-world\u201d settings. OpenAI plans to create new sensors and computational elements for its robotics, which will be powered by AI models that the company develops internally.\n\n\u201cWorking across the entire model stack, we integrate cutting-edge hardware and software to explore a broad range of robotic form factors,\u201d reads one of the listings. \u201cWe strive to seamlessly blend high-level AI capabilities with the physical constraints of physical robotic platforms.\u201d\n\nOne of the listings implies that OpenAI intends to employ contract workers to test its robotic prototypes. Another suggests that the company\u2019s robots might have limbs.\n\nThe Information recently reported that OpenAI has explored building its own humanoid robot.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

OpenAI appears to be bullish on the effort. In another listing, the company says it is seeking an engineer with \u201cexperience designing mechanical systems intended for high volume (1M+).\u201d\n\nRobotics is a hot commodity. The sector raised over $6.4 billion from VCs last year, according to Crunchbase, illustrating the interest in a technology with potentially endless applications.\n\nCompanies like Bright Machines and Collaborative Robotics, which develop software and systems for factory manufacturing, appear to have successfully found a niche. So have firms like Carbon Robotics, which is creating an AI-enabled weeding robot, and Bear Robotics, which makes a mobile robot capable of carrying trays and packages.\n\nHumanoid robots have attracted the most publicity, however.\n\n1X and Figure, both of which have OpenAI backing, are attempting to create general-purpose robots that move more or less like humans. The challenges are formidable, but these companies claim that technology has reached the point where mass-produced humanoid robotic systems are a realistic near-term goal.\n\nThe many disappointments in recent robotics history suggest that will be easier said than achieved.\n\nRobots aren\u2019t the only hardware project OpenAI is actively working on. Legendary ex-Apple product designer Jony Ive confirmed last year that he is collaborating with OpenAI on a new device, and OpenAI is said to be designing a custom chip for running its AI models.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!
