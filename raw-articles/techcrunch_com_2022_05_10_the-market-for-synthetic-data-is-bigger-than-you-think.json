Since such projects are on the rise, the correlation is that the market for synthetic data is also set to grow.\n\nLast but not least is the time horizon. In our startup world, 2024 is almost today, and people at Gartner already have a longer-term prediction: Some of its team published a piece of research \u201cForget About Your Real Data \u2014 Synthetic Data Is the Future of AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe future of AI\u201d is the kind of promise that investors like to hear, so it\u2019s no surprise that checks have been flowing into synthetic data startups.\n\nIn 2022 alone, MOSTLY AI raised a $25 million Series B round led by Molten Ventures; Datagen landed a $50 million Series B led by Scale Venture Partners, and Synthesis AI pocketed a $17 million Series A.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But they expect use cases to keep on expanding, both inside new sectors as well as those where synthetic data is already common.\n\nTo understand what\u2019s happening, but also what\u2019s coming if synthetic data does get more broadly adopted, we talked to various CEOs and VCs over the last few months. We learned about the two main categories of synthetic data companies, which sectors they address, how to size the market and more.\n\nThe tip of the iceberg\n\nQuiet Capital\u2019s founding partner, Astasia Myers, is one of the investors bullish about synthetic data and its applications. She declined to disclose whether she invested in this space, but said that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot to be excited about in the synthetic data world.\u201d\n\nWhy the enthusiasm? \u201cBecause it gives teams faster access to data in a secure way at a lower cost,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\n\nAccess to large troves of data has become critical for machine learning teams, and real data is often not up to the task, for different reasons. This is the gap that synthetic data startups are hoping to fill.\n\nThere are two main contexts in which these startups focus: structured data and unstructured data. The former refers to the kind of datasets that sit in tables and spreadsheets, while the latter points toward what we could call media files, such as audio, text and visual data.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to distinguish between structured and unstructured synthetic data companies,\u201d Myers said, \u201cbecause the synthetic data type is applied to different use cases and therefore different buyers.\u201d\n\nAccording to MOSTLY AI CEO Tobias Hann, most of the demand for structured synthetic data comes from banking, insurance, telecommunications and healthcare companies.\n\nThese four highly regulated sectors are attracted by the possibility of plentiful \u2014 yet privacy-preserving \u2014 data. Whether synthetic data can deliver this or not is still somewhat controversial, but several companies think so, as do their investors.\n\nRecently funded companies in this structured data vertical include MOSTLY AI; Tonic.ai, which raised a $35 million Series B funding round; and Gretel AI, which closed a $50 million Series B round last October. A fuller list and market map can be found in this Medium post by synthetic data advocate Elise Devaux, whose employer Statice is also a competitor.\n\nAs captured by Devaux, the unstructured synthetic data side of the market is represented by a whole other range of companies, such as the above-mentioned Datagen and Synthesis AI. Some, such as Parallel Domain, appeared a few years ago, while others, such as Scale AI, entered the space more recently. But they have one thing in common: They have no need to envy their structured data peers when it comes to attracting funding or clients.\n\nVisual synthetic data, for instance, has a variety of use cases. According to Datagen CEO Ofir Zuk (Chakon), four of these are accelerating faster than others: AR/VR/metaverse, in-cabin automotive and automotive in general, smart conferencing and home security.\n\nHowever, Datagen is also making sure its algorithms and technology are domain agnostic to ensure it will be ready when synthetic data usage takes off in other sectors, such as retail and robotics. And there\u2019s little reason to doubt that it will be the case.\n\nAn ongoing democratization\n\n\u201cDeep learning with synthetic data will democratize the tech industry,\u201d general partner at LDV Capital Evan Nisselson predicted in a 2018 TechCrunch guest column.\n\nBy democratization, Nisselson meant leveling the playing field. By using synthetic data, startups would be able to do applied machine learning without the type of big data that only large tech companies had at that point.\n\nNisselson\u2019s prediction both held up and didn\u2019t. Synthetic data helped underdogs in their David-Goliath fight. But now, Meta and the like want to have their cake and eat it, too. Nisselson acknowledges as much.\n\nIn 2018, \u201ca lot of the people at big companies said: \u2018Evan, we have more data than we need, we don\u2019t need to make synthetic data.\u2019\u201d The only exception was for addressing edge cases in applications such as autonomous vehicles.\n\n\u201cBut many things have changed, and I think more and more [big companies] will leverage synthetic media,\u201d Nisselson said.\n\nSynthetic data has selling points that can appeal to companies of all sizes. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster and sometimes cheaper way to train systems,\u201d Nisselson said. This is in part because the data is itself generated with AI, for instance via generative adversarial networks (GANs). But it is also because costly steps such as annotation and labeling could potentially be skipped.\n\nIf one buys into the bullish hypothesis on synthetic data becoming the main form of training data, it becomes easy to calculate its total addressable market (TAM), Zuk said. \u201cWe can simply say that the TAM of synthetic data and the TAM of data will converge.\u201d\n\nThis market could even be bigger than expected if new use cases are unlocked within companies. \u201cWe are just starting to see the early innings of synthetic data\u2019s role in organizations,\u201d Myers said.\n\nIt is not clear yet how this democratization within organizations will happen, but a low-code or no-code approach will likely help. MOSTLY AI\u2019s strategy, for example, is very much focused on unlocking business value for clients that include Fortune 100 banks and insurers, as well as telcos. Because of this, the startup created a platform that can not only be used by data scientists, but also by software engineers and quality testers.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nSome applications of synthetic data are still novel for the general public, but already too late for a VC firm like LDV, whose thesis is to invest as early as possible in teams leveraging cutting-edge technology.\n\nThis makes Nisselson interesting to talk to, keeping that bias in mind. For instance, he describes synthetic data applied to transportation or to robotics \u2014 such as training robots to pick up items in warehouses or factory lines \u2014 as \u201ccrowded\u201d already.\n\nUse cases highlighted by Nisselson also included training autonomous retail, like AiFi does; marketing, advertising, and e-learning, like his portfolio company Synthesia, which uses synthetic avatars for corporate training; gaming, including the metaverse; and what he calls \u201cpure content creation.\u201d\n\nMyers too highlighted the use of synthetic data in content creation. \u201cSynthetic data is most affiliated with deepfakes that replace one person\u2019s likeness or voice with synthetic versions,\u201d she said, but \u201cthese technologies can also be applied to commercial applications.\u201d\n\nOne thing is for sure: With startups blossoming and use cases aplenty, some of these companies will eventually buy each other or get acquired by tech giants. Last October, even before rebranding as Meta, Facebook already quietly acquired AI.Reverie. With other large companies partnering with synthetic data startups more or less openly, and considering the current venture capital climate, we would be surprised if some of these didn\u2019t lead to M&As in the near future. It\u2019s something that we will definitely be tracking."}
