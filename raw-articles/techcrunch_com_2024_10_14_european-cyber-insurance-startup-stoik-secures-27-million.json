While many companies try to avoid and mitigate cyber risks, they rarely discuss transferring those risks to a third party.\n\nThat\u2019s why Sto\u00efk is stepping in with a cybersecurity insurance product specifically designed for small- and medium-sized businesses. The French startup recently raised a \u20ac25 million Series B round (around $27 million at current exchange rates).\n\nIn many ways, Sto\u00efk follows in the footsteps of companies like Coalition and At-Bay. However, instead of selling its insurance products to U.S.-based companies, Sto\u00efk focuses exclusively on European companies.\n\nOnce insured by Sto\u00efk, businesses are covered against cybersecurity-related claims. For instance, if a company needs to halt production or temporarily close due to a cyber incident, Sto\u00efk can compensate for loss of revenue (gross operating margin) during that period.\n\nSto\u00efk currently covers companies with annual turnover of \u20ac750 million or less and offers coverage limits of \u20ac7.5 million. At present, the company operates in France, Germany, and Austria.\n\nThe startup chose this particular vertical because cyber insurance is more complex than other types of insurance products. Sto\u00efk has also built a small in-house crisis management team to respond to incidents and assist with data recovery and crisis communication.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of the week, we\u2019ve had a dozen attacks on our portfolio, including a major one,\u201d co-founder and CEO Jules Veyrat told TechCrunch last week. \u201cWe have people mobilized in the Lyon region for a ransomware attack that brought an industrial company to a standstill.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The startup monitors DNS records and scans online databases for password leaks associated with the customer\u2019s domain name. Sto\u00efk can also perform internal scans to recommend changes to cloud and active directory configurations.\n\n\u201cOur thesis is that we\u2019re going to insure companies. On top of that, we\u2019re going to help them better protect themselves against cyberattacks. That way, they\u2019re happy, they get more for the same price, and we\u2019re happy, because we have policyholders who are well protected, and therefore have fewer claims than others,\u201d Veyrat said.\n\nSto\u00efk still has some similarities with the broader insurance industry \u2014 it has to ensure it doesn\u2019t accept too many bad apples in its portfolio of clients, as it could significantly impact the company\u2019s loss ratio.\n\n\u201cThe insurers\u2019 job is to select the risk. So, who do I accept and under what conditions? How well do they understand cyber?\u201d Veyrat said. \u201cIn other words, am I willing to take on a \u20ac50 million industrial company that has no offline backup strategy? This is just an example, but these are the questions we ask ourselves every day.\u201d\n\nSto\u00efk acts as a managing general agent (MGA), meaning that it works with insurance and reinsurance companies so that they cover the risks. Sto\u00efk gets to create its own rates, products, and policies \u2014 but it outsources the risk to bigger insurance companies.\n\nOne such partner is Tokio Marine HCC International, which is the only new investor in the Series B funding round. Existing investors also invested in the round. Alven is leading the Series B with Andreessen Horowitz, Munich Re Ventures, Opera Tech Ventures, and Anthemis also participating.\n\nSto\u00efk doesn\u2019t sell its insurance products to its customers directly. Instead, it works with third-party insurance brokers that already have a relationship with SMBs. So far, Sto\u00efk has attracted 1,000 insurance brokers.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Sto\u00efk should have 5,000 policyholders. It currently represents \u20ac25 million in premiums and plans to ramp up customer signups in the future. The startup expects to expand into a new country every year starting with a new European market in late 2024 or early 2025."}
