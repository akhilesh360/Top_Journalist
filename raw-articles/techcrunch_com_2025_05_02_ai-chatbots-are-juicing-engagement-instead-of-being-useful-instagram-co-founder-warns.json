OpenAI has apologized for the problem and blamed \u201cshort-term feedback\u201d from users for it.\n\nSystrom suggested that chatbots being overly engaging is not a bug but an intentional feature designed for AI companies to show off metrics like time spent and daily active users. AI companies should be \u201claser-focused\u201d on providing high-quality answers rather than moving metrics in the easiest way possible, he said.\n\nSystrom didn\u2019t name any specific AI companies in his remarks. He didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn response, OpenAI pointed TechCrunch to its user specs, which state that its AI model \u201coften does not have all of the information\u201d to provide a good answer and may ask for \u201cclarification or more details.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
