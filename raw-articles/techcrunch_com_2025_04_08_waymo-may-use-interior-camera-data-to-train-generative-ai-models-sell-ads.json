This isn\u2019t new; Waymo already collects personal data to improve services and for advertising purposes, per its existing privacy policy.\n\nWhat will change when this feature is released is that riders will have an opportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of having their personal information sold, shared, or used for AI training.\n\nWaymo is working on Generative AI training using \u201cinterior camera data associated with rider\u2019s identity,\u201d provides opt-opts for this and data sharing under CCPA\n\n\n\nWaymo explicitly states in this unreleased Privacy page it may share your data for personalized ads pic.twitter.com/wDUu867Eh3 \u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) April 5, 2025\n\n\u201cThe feature, which is still under development, will not introduce any changes to Waymo\u2019s Privacy Policy, but rather will offer riders an opportunity to opt out of data collection for [machine learning] training purposes,\u201d Julia Ilina, a Waymo spokesperson, told TechCrunch.\n\nThe unreleased privacy page states: \u201cWaymo may share data to improve and analyze its functionality and to tailor products, services, ads, and offers to your interests. You can opt out of sharing your information with third parties, unless it\u2019s necessary to the functioning of the service.\u201d\n\nThat language is standard in today\u2019s world; bringing cameras into the mix is what ratchets up the creepiness factor.\n\n\u201cOpt out of Waymo, or its affiliates, using your personal information (including interior camera data associated with your identity) for training [generative AI],\u201d reads the draft language of the unreleased page.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

As of February, the company is logging more than 200,000 paid robotaxi rides every week via its commercial services in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin. That\u2019s up from 10,000 rides per week just two years ago and is a harbinger of more growth as Waymo expands into new markets. The company aims to launch a commercial service in Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., over the next two years.\n\nDespite these gains, Waymo is still likely a money loser for Alphabet, which might be why the company appears to be exploring other revenue streams, like in-vehicle advertising and data sharing for generative AI models.\n\nLast year, Alphabet poured another $5 billion into Waymo, and the company raised an additional $5.6 billion from outside investors that boosted its valuation to more than $45 billion.\n\nWaymo is still investing heavily in R&D and incurring the costs of expansion, including growing its fleet, buying specialized equipment, vehicle maintenance, and charging infrastructure.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far Waymo is from breaking even, much less profitability. Alphabet doesn\u2019t break out Waymo\u2019s financials in its earnings report. Instead, Waymo is included in Alphabet\u2019s \u201cother bets\u201d section of its balance sheet, which in 2024 recorded an operating loss of $1.2 billion.\n\nThis article was originally published April 7, 2025 at 9:04 am PT.
