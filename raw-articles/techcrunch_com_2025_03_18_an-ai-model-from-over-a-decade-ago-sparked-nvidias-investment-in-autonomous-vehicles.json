But the company also snuck in a little history lesson.\n\nDuring the automotive portion of his speech, Huang referred to AlexNet, a neural network architecture that gained widespread attention in 2012 when it won a computer image-recognition contest. Designed by computer scientist Alex Krizhevsky in collaboration with Ilya Sutskever (who\u2019d go on to found OpenAI) and AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton, AlexNet achieved 84.7% accuracy in an academic competition called ImageNET.\n\nThe breakthrough result led to a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a subset of machine learning that leverages neural networks.\n\nTurns out, AlexNet spurred Nvidia to go \u201call in\u201d on autonomous vehicles, the way Huang tells it.\n\n\u201cThe moment I saw AlexNet \u2014 and we\u2019ve been working on computer vision for a long time \u2014 the moment I saw AlexNet was such an inspiring moment, such an exciting moment,\u201d he said onstage. \u201cIt caused us to decide to go all in on building self-driving cars. So we\u2019ve been working on self-driving cars now for over a decade. We build technology that almost every single self-driving car company uses.\u201d\n\nNvidia has notched partnerships with numerous automakers, automotive suppliers, and tech companies developing autonomous vehicles. Its latest, an expanded collaboration with GM, was announced this afternoon.\n\nAutomakers like Tesla and autonomous vehicle developers Wayve and Waymo use Nvidia GPUs for data centers. Other companies tap Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse product to build \u201cdigital twins\u201d of factories to virtually test production processes and design vehicles. Meanwhile, Mercedes, Volvo, Toyota, and Zoox have used Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin computer system-on-chip, which is based on the chipmaker\u2019s Nvidia Ampere supercomputing architecture. Toyota and others are also employing Nvidia\u2019s safety-focused operating system, DriveOS.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
