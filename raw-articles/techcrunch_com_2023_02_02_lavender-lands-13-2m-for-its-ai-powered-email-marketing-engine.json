Just as Sorter was heading to market, the pandemic hit \u2014 and marketing budgets froze. With a week of funding left, Allred and Ballance pivoted, repackaging their tech to work in Gmail in what they thought would be a brief detour to Sorter\u2019s launch.\n\nBut users liked the repackaged product \u2014 and so did investors. So Sorter became Lavender, an AI-powered sales email coaching platform.\n\nLavender integrates with email providers to serve up context on a sales prospect and suggest ways to optimize the message to get a reply. Showing that there\u2019s money in the idea, the company today announced that it raised $13.2 million across a Series A round led Norwest Venture Partners with participation from Signia Venture Partners and a seed round led by Signia with contributions from CapitalX, Position Ventures and various angel investors.\n\n\u201cBy combining deep learning on email data with communication and behavioral psychology, Lavender\u2019s AI writing assistant identifies and implements ways to increase reply rates,\u201d Ballance told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cIn today\u2019s climate, teams have to do more with less. While sales team sizes shrink due to layoffs, teams use Lavender to make each rep more effective and efficient.\u201d\n\nLavender\u2019s product is made up of three different components: a sales email coach, a \u201cpersonalization assistant\u201d and an email intelligence and coaching portal. The email tools provide research material (e.g. news and updates, funding stats, job listings, events, tweets and more) on recipients and can automatically create drafts from that research (\u00e0 la ChatGPT), or simply generate a few bullet points to work within a preexisting email thread. As an email\u2019s written, Lavender scores it in real time, suggesting improvements in specific areas.\n\n\u201cWriting a \u2018better email\u2019 is a four-step process \u2014 research, create, edit and learn \u2014 and our product helps across all four,\u201d Ballance said. \u201cInstead of automating, we help users write effective personalized emails faster. The AI works alongside them, but doesn\u2019t replace them.\u201d\n\nLavender\u2019s aforementioned learning portal, meanwhile, aggregates and analyzes email activity, highlighting areas in need of improvement. Managers using Lavender can see which email templates are working versus which aren\u2019t for instance, as well as metrics like individual email scores, open rates, reply rates and writing time.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That\u2019s not a feature likely to thrill every rep, particularly those who value their own processes and privacy. But Ballance makes the case that it\u2019s a net good where an organization\u2019s sales are at stake.\n\n\u201cSales teams have become too focused on optimizing for efficiency and automation. This forced optimization has left buyers with a bad impression of sellers, because they feel as if they\u2019re just a number,\u201d he said. \u201cSales needs to go back to building real relationships \u2014 not automation and spam. Lavender makes real personalized emails faster for our users.\u201d\n\nWhile Lavender isn\u2019t the only firm applying automation to the marketing and sales outreach segment, it\u2019s certainly benefiting from the general boom time. According to a 2022 report from Ascend2 and Research Partners, 69% of marketers say that their overall customer journey is partially or mostly automated while 9% say that theirs is fully automated. The same report found that nearly a third \u2014 31% \u2014 of marketing professionals planned to purchase a marketing automation solution in the next 12 months.\n\nLavender\u2019s rivals include Sellscale, which similarly uses generative AI to write marketing emails, and marketing automation startup Klaviyo, which received a large investment from Shopify last August. (Ballance sees Jasper and Regie as competitors, too; both leverage text-generating AI for marketing copy drafting.) Lavender has a respectable customer base, though, totaling around 11,000 sellers at organizations including Twilio, Segment, Sendoso, Sharebite and Clari.\n\n\u201cWe built for nearly two more years before raising venture capital,\u201d Ballance said, declining to answer a question about recurring revenue. \u201cLavender is well-capitalized to continue building in the current market.\n\nLavender\u2019s team recently grew to 16 employees, up from six in Q4 2022. Ballance says that the startup \u2014 which has raised $14.2 million in total to date \u2014 will continue to expand and fill \u201ckey roles\u201d throughout the rest of the year."}
