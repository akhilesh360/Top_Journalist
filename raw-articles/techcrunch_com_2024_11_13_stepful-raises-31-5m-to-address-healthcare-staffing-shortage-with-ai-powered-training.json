But when the pandemic struck, he saw many people lose their jobs overnight.\n\nHe noticed that there was a significant shortage of medical assistants, a career that was recession-proof and provided attractive pay and benefits. So, Madi (pictured above in the center) wondered if he could help cleaners become medical assistants.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked into it, I realized that most pathways are either trade schools or community colleges,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can take up to two years and cost up to $20,000.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, he teamed up with Tressia Hobeika (pictured left), who had previously worked at Udacity, and ex-Apple engineer Edoardo Serra (pictured right) to found Stepful, an AI-powered online program that trains people for entry-level healthcare jobs like medical assistants and pharmacy technicians in four months at an average cost of $2,500.\n\nSince then, Stepful has grown from having only 50 students in its first year to expecting 30,000 enrollees in 2024.\n\nMadi says students like the fact that Stepful balances flexibility with structure. Although students can do a lot of their learning asynchronously and in bite sizes on their phones, they must attend a weekly instructor-led class and work in groups. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more engaging way of learning,\u201d Madi said.\n\nAfter completing the online coursework, Stepful automatically matches students with one of its 8,000 partner clinics or hospitals throughout the country for one or two months of hands-on training.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

We can train them, and then if we like them, we will hire them,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe company also boasts a 75% graduation rate, which Stepful achieves by having its AI send personalized messages to students who are falling behind. And if that doesn\u2019t help get people back on track, a human coach intervenes to provide additional motivation. \u201cPeople feel that they\u2019re supported, nurtured, and we see them,\u201d Madi said.\n\nStudents seem to like the education Stepful offers them, but they aren\u2019t the only ones who are flocking to the company. On Wednesday, Stepful announced that it raised a $31.5 million Series B led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Y Combinator, Reach Capital, AlleyCorp, and others. The funding comes less than nine months after Stepful raised its $12 million Series A.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that there\u2019s a huge demand for allied health professionals,\u201d said Vig Chandramouli, a partner with Oak HC/FT. In fact, the U.S. healthcare system is projected to soon be short of 3.2 million workers, including allied health professionals such as medical technicians and assistants, as well as nurses and mental health professionals, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\nOak HC/FT has looked at other startups that help solve the healthcare worker shortage but found that staffing companies like Nomad Health have narrow gross margins and don\u2019t help to increase the supply of professionals, Chandramouli said.\n\n\u201cWhat we liked about Stepful was that it is taking people who are hourly workers, in most cases, and getting them into the healthcare field where they have steady salaries and proper benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also clever in how they\u2019re leveraging generative AI.\u201d\n\nIn other words, by relying on GenAI, Stepful ensures that its metrics look more like a tech business with much fewer humans in the loop than a regular education program."}
