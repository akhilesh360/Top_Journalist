Working with the e-commerce division within Yahoo, the AlltheWeb team retooled its search tech into a more general-purpose tool that Yahoo developers could use internally to compute over large-scale data sets in real time.\n\nOver the next decade or so, Yahoo expanded Vespa along several axes, enabling the tool to handle input beyond text strings, personalize content based on users\u2019 click-through histories and take direction from machine learning algorithms. Then, in 2017, Yahoo open sourced Vespa, hoping to rally developer support behind the software \u2014 and foster something of an ecosystem both internally and externally.\n\nEvidently, it paid off.\n\nThousands of brands, including Spotify, OkCupid and Wix, now use either the open source release of Vespa or Vespa\u2019s cloud-hosted, fully managed product, Vespa Cloud. Vespa still drives searches and related-article recommendations on many Yahoo-owned sites \u2014 performing ad targeting on Yahoo-branded web properties such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo News and Yahoo\u2019s advertising network.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For example, he says, Vespa offers a mode, \u201cvector streaming search,\u201d that can \u201cdramatically\u201d cut the cost of an app retrieving personal data such as emails and documents.\n\n\u201cVespa [provides] end-to-end services that allow clients to use any combination of text and structured data to provide quality results with sophisticated scoring and relevance at scale,\u201d Bratseth said. \u201cVespa solves the problem many AI applications, including large language models [along the lines of ChatGPT], are starting to face as they increase the amount of customers and data needed to function while also allowing Fortune 500 and enterprise customers to leverage AI to streamline their operations and improve their bottom line.\u201d\n\nFree of Yahoo (except for Yahoo\u2019s stake in Vespa and seat on Vespa\u2019s board of directors), Bratseth says that Vespa, whose team now stands at 29 people, has the capability to expand its cloud services.\n\n\u201cThose who already use Vespa now have the opportunity to move to Vespa Cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cVespa is a startup with a huge growth potential from our large base of open source enterprise usage, which would benefit greatly from moving to our managed version of the platform.\u201d"}
