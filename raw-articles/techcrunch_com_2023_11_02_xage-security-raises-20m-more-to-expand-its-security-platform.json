According to Statista, there were 148 deals in Q2 2023 worth a combined $1.6 billion.\n\nAnd \u2014 at least anecdotally \u2014 Q3 deal flow seems healthy, too. Case in point, Xage Security, a startup providing software to thwart network intrusions, today announced that it raised $20 million in a B2 funding round that brings the company\u2019s total raised to $80 million.\n\nPiva Capital, March Capital, SCF Partners, Overture Climate Fund, Valor Equity Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures and Science Applications International Corporation participated in Xage\u2019s B2. A source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch that the premoney valuation is roughly 60% higher than Xage\u2019s premoney as of January 2022, when the company initially closed its Series B.\n\nGeoffrey Mattson, who was appointed Xage\u2019s CEO in September, says the proceeds will be put toward R&D and expanding Xage\u2019s go-to-market operations \u2014 with a focus on expanding its presence in the Asia Pacific region.\n\n\u201cDespite the mixed tech economic conditions, cybersecurity attacks on critical infrastructure are on the rise, and Xage has seen strengthening tailwinds versus headwinds given the threat environment and customers\u2019 needs,\u201d Mattson told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWith more businesses operating remotely to reduce costs, delivering zero trust security solutions to critical infrastructure and distributed operations including operational technology, IT and cloud environments has never been more important \u2014 and prioritized.\u201d\n\nXage was founded by Susanto Irwan and Roman Arutyunov in 2016 after the two came to realize that attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including devices like surveillance cameras and temperature sensors, were growing. (The trend continues; in the first two months of 2023, there was a 41% uptick in the average number of weekly attacks per organization targeting IoT devices compared to 2022.)\n\nWith Xage, Irwan and Arutyunov set out to develop a cybersecurity platform that could protect IoT devices and operational technology \u2014 the hardware and software used to monitor, control and upgrade industrial systems \u2014 whether they\u2019re isolated or connected to the cloud.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Xage \u201csees\u201d device interactions and data movement and changes on a company\u2019s network, spotting policy violations and executing security policies like invoking multifactor authentication for system logins from unknown locations.\n\nXage certainly isn\u2019t alone in the market for platforms to secure IoT and industrial systems. Dragos is perhaps its biggest rival \u2014 at least on the startup front. But Xage has done well for itself where it concerns customer acquisition, securing a $17 million contract with the U.S. Space Force and a $743,000 contract with the U.S. Air Force.\n\nXage\u2019s other clients include infrastructure operators in energy, manufacturing, utilities and transportation. Mattson claims that the ~90-employee startup\u2019s revenue grew 420% while bookings grew 560% in the first half of 2023 year-over-year.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic first hit, Xage saw a short pause in demand as customers tried to sort out their own businesses,\u201d Mattson said. \u201cLuckily, Xage had a comfortable runway as companies are seeing information and data security as key to their continued operations."}
