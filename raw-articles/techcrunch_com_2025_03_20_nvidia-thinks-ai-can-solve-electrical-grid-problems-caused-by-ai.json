Perhaps ironically, the issues are largely caused by rising power demand from AI itself.\n\nThe Open Power AI Consortium, which includes a number of electrical utilities and tech companies, says it will use what are known as domain-specific AI models to devise new ways to tackle problems that the power industry is predicted to face in the coming years. The models will be open sourced and available to researchers across academia and industry.\n\nThe power industry is facing surging demand from data centers in the United States and elsewhere as AI ramps up the need for computing power. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 4% annually in the coming years, according to the International Energy Agency, nearly double over 2023 figures.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia and EPRI, the consortium includes PG&E, Con Edison, Constellation Energy, Duke Energy, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and ENOWA, NEOM\u2019s energy and water company. On the tech side, Microsoft and Oracle are both members.\n\nIn an attempt to stay ahead of the trend, tech companies have been racing to secure generating capacity as power has transformed from a simple line item to a competitive advantage.\n\nOver the last year or so, tech companies have been consistently inking new contracts. They\u2019ve largely been spread across renewable energy projects, spurred mostly by solar\u2019s low cost, modularity, and the speed at which it can be deployed.\n\nMicrosoft, for example, recently added 475 megawatts of solar power to its sizable renewable portfolio. Last year, it became an anchor investor in a $9 billion renewable development project run by Acadia, and earlier in the year it said it was working with Brookfield asset management to deploy 10.5 gigawatts of renewable power in the U.S. and Europe, all of which is expected to come online by 2030.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
