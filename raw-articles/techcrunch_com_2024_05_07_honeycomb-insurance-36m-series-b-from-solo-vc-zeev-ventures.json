He looked to start a business in a market divided among many competitors, eventually settling on building a company that offers property and casualty insurance for landlords and condo associations.\n\nThe largest carrier in landlord insurance \u2014 Travelers \u2014 represented only about 7% of the market, and the rest of the competitive landscape was distributed among 100 smaller providers, Ben-Zaken told TechCrunch.\n\nBen-Zaken wasn\u2019t a stranger to insurance. Before starting Comprendi, he spent four years running Insurance.com at QuinStreet, an operator of white-labeled financial services marketplaces.\n\nHe launched Honeycomb Insurance in 2019, and after spending two years building the company\u2019s computer vision and AI-driven property \u201cinspection\u201d technology, the company sold its first policy in 2021. Ben-Zaken says that Honeycomb\u2019s AI relies on aerial photographs of building roofs, often eliminating the need for costly physical inspections.\n\nThe company raised a $15 million Series A in early 2022 and is currently on track to sell $130 million of insurance premiums in 2024, a threefold increase from last year.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nWhen Honeycomb was gearing up to raise its Series B earlier this year, one of the first calls Ben-Zaken made was to solo venture capitalist Oren Zeev, who\u2019s known for being one of the largest shareholders in Navan, Houzz, Next Insurance and Tipalti.\n\n\u201cI was blown away by what I saw,\u201d Zeev said about Honeycomb. He agreed to back Honeycomb, but only if Ben-Zaken would agree not to market the deal to other investors.\n\nBen-Zaken didn\u2019t think twice about Zeev\u2019s proposal: He dreamed of having the solo VC as his backer and on Honeycomb\u2019s board since he founded the company.\n\nZeev wrote a $30 million check to Honeycomb, making him the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Other participants in the $36 million Series B that the Chicago-based startup is announcing on Tuesday include new investors Arkin Holdings and Launchbay Capital and returning backers Ibex Investors, Phoenix Insurance, and IT-Farm.\n\nZeev, too, is not a stranger to the insurtech space \u2014 he holds a large stake in Next Insurance and was a backer of Hippo Insurance before it went public via a SPAC in 2021 \u2014 but he said he is not generally \u201ca fan\u201d of the sector.\n\n\u201cI was not looking for another investment in insurance,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThe bar is very high because I am aware of the challenges.\u201d\n\nBesides the company\u2019s fast growth, what attracted Zeev to Honeycomb is that landlord insurance is a \u201csleepy\u201d industry ready for innovation, but also the sector is not large enough for insurance giants to want to tackle it. In other words, Zeev isn\u2019t worried that major players will encroach on Honeycomb\u2019s territory, as they did on Ben-Zaken\u2019s first startup.\n\nAccording to Ben-Zaken, the landlord and condo association insurance market continues to be highly fragmented. He says there are two startups in the space: Steadily, which raised a $28.5 million Series B last July, and Obie, which closed on a $25.5 million Series B from Battery Ventures a year ago.\n\nHoneycomb will use its new funding to double its headcount from 90 to 180 employees over the next 18 months, introduce new products, and expand its offerings to new markets.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to go beyond landlord insurance,\u201d Ben Zaken said, adding that his company\u2019s goal is to be a one-stop shop for commercial real estate insurance."}
