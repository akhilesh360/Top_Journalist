CEO Muddu Sudhakar said the new cash will be put toward market expansion and supporting Aisera\u2019s go-to-market strategy, in addition to investing in the company\u2019s product development, R&D, sales and marketing initiatives.\n\nSudhakar says he built Aisera after perceiving the need for \u201cpredictive AI\u201d solutions that could auto-resolve customer service, IT, sales and operations problems. Leveraging AI, the platform plugs into existing systems of record, including help desk portals, to respond to incoming inquiries and requests.\n\nSudhakar founded Aisera in 2017 alongside Christos Tryfonas, a longtime colleague. Sudhakar most recently led teams at ServiceNow and EMC, previously founding startups (Caspida, Cetas, Kazeon and Sanera Systems) that were acquired by VMware and Splunk. Tryfonas, a former AT&T Bell Labs researcher, worked with Sudhakar at several of his ventures before joining Aisera.\n\n\u201cWe thought [the pandemic] would be a problem, but Aisera\u2019s technology does very well in remote environments. Customers wanted AI and automation to drive user engagement and adoption,\u201d Sudhakar told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cNow in the current market downturn, we\u2019re seeing the need for cost reduction on licenses and people. This is driving demand for Aisera as we\u2019re able to help organizations reduce costs for IT and business services.\u201d\n\nThe way Sudhakar explains it, Aisera\u2019s platform learns to resolve issues through a combination of language-analyzing AI and robotic process automation, or RPA. RPA technology attempts to mimic the way people interact with software to accomplish basic, repeatable tasks at scale. It\u2019s not a particularly novel idea \u2014 RPA vendors, including Automation Anywhere and UiPath, claim to be able to do this to some extent. But Sudhakar asserts that Aisera\u2019s brand of RPA is custom-built for customer/employee service use cases.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, Aisera competes with ServiceNow and Zendesk, but it\u2019s also complementary to those solutions as we partner with them as well as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Salesforce, Atlassian, and Cisco,\u201d Sudhakar said. \u201cAisera is unique and differentiated with ontology and taxonomy for each domain and vertical industry \u2026 [We also do] AI learning and training on customer data sets to capture specific intents, phrases, utterances required for natural language processing and natural language understanding.\u201d\n\nWhen a request comes in via email, voice, a ticket or a chatroom, Aisera attempts to understand it by analyzing it with an algorithm trained to understand language. The platform then cross-references sources like ServiceNow, Salesforce, Oracle, Confluence and SharePoint for customer data to personalize its replies to the request. After that step, Aisera creates a list of actions that need to be completed to fulfill the request, which it submits to a \u201cworkflow management\u201d engine.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Moreover, it can automatically take certain actions itself, like resetting a user\u2019s password \u2014 that\u2019s where the RPA comes in \u2014 or route requests to the appropriate team. For trickier problems, Aisera can provide \u201cnext-best action\u201d recommendations to teams as well, improving with each additional data point.\n\n\u201cOur technology helps companies improve their operational results while enabling them to constrain costs associated with help and service desk support, customer service and support, and [more],\u201d Sudhakar added. \u201cAisera delivers solutions for both large and small organizations that can be used across business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets for IT, HR, cybersecurity, customer service, sales, marketing, legal, and finance departments.\u201d\n\nAisera claims to do a lot. Unfortunately, without access to internal data, it\u2019s tough to known how well its product works in practice. The platform supposedly recognizes over 70 languages, but does it understand all of those languages equally well? What happens when Aisera makes a mistake (e.g., fetches the wrong support article) in resolving requests?\n\nIn response to TechCrunch\u2019s questions, Sudhakar said: \u201cIn the case that conversational AI understanding and fulfillment (resolution) are incorrect, Aisera [can codify] error and warning scenarios [or allow customers to] talk to a live agent or create a case or callback. Aisera also has an alert and notification studio that can trigger workflows to notify users and admins in case of workflow failures.\u201d\n\nTaking a step back to examine the larger industry, though, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a strong interest in AI technologies for customer service. A 2021 survey from ManageEngine (the IT division of Zoho) found that 59% of execs in the U.S. are applying AI \u2014 for example, in chatbots \u2014 to enhance customer service in some way. Whether realistic or no, AI is viewed by many as a path to higher efficiency (i.e., handling more customer inquiries with fewer resources) and greater personalization (e.g., upselling).\n\nIt\u2019s no panacea \u2014 findings are mixed on whether customers prefer even basic chatbots to human agents. But the hype around AI has fueled the rise of startups such as Lang.ai, which automatically tags customer conversations to resolve service issues. Last year, Zendesk acquired Cleverly, whose product platform provided a series of AI-powered capabilities, including a triage function to automatically tag incoming service requests to help categorize workflow. There\u2019s also Ultimate.ai, a data-ingesting, bot-builder platform; Ushur, which offers a service for businesses to create AI-based communication flows; and Tidio, a suite of live chat apps and AI-powered chatbots.\n\nCompetition aside, Sudhakar believes Aisera is well-positioned for growth with over 100 customers and close to 80 million users. Current subscribers include brands like Zoom, Chegg, McAfee, and Autodesk, plus federal, state, military and defense agencies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a somewhat recession-proof industry where our cloud-native and AI-native technology can better accommodate budgets in contrast to others. AI and automation are key foundational pillars to beat inflation,\u201d Sudhakar said. \u201cAisera is experiencing massive growth \u2014 300% year-over-year \u2014 with gross margins between 80% to 90%. . . . While the tech industry faces levels of uncertainty and some economic headwinds, business for Aisera is booming.\u201d\n\nTo date, Aisera, which employees around 250 people, has raised $180 million in capital."}
