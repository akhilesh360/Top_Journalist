The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered:\n\n\u201cThank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.\u201d\n\nThe first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread:\n\n\u201cHi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.\u201d\n\nHowever, the problem apparently has not yet been solved. Cryptoteddybear claims that a company representative told him that he asked the technicians to increase the priority given to solving the bug.\n\nAs Cointelegraph recently reported, TradingView is one of the platforms that added the \u201cCIX100\u201d index \u2014 an AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens.\n\nAt the beginning of the current month, cryptocurrency analytics company Coin Metrics announced that it has acquired digital asset index firm Bletchley Indexes and plans to launch crypto smart beta indexes.\n\nAs of press time, TradingView has not responded to a request for comment."}
