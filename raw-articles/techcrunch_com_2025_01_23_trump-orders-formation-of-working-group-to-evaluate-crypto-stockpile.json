The group will also include the Treasury secretary, the attorney general, the secretary of Commerce, and other top officials.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest executive order \u2014 titled \u201cStrengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology\u201d \u2014 comes two days after the Securities and Exchange Commission, currently led by crypto-friendly Republican Mark Uyeda, launched a crypto task force to \u201cdraw clear regulatory lines\u201d for the market. Uyeda will also be a part of the presidential working group.\n\nFormer SEC Chair Gary Gensler had a reputation in the crypto community for pursuing stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTrump\u2019s order also protects individuals\u2019 rights to access, use, develop, and transact on public blockchain. This would formally protect blockchain activities as lawful.\n\nThe EO signed Thursday repeals Biden-era rules around cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Specifically, it repeals an executive order from former President Joe Biden signed in 2022 to address the risks and harness the potential benefits of digital assets and their underlying blockchain technology, while emphasizing the need to protect consumers and investors. Trump\u2019s order also repeals a framework published by the Treasury Department in 2022 for international engagement in crypto and blockchain development.\n\nWhile Biden-era policies focused on risk mitigation and international collaboration, Trump\u2019s order prioritizes economic liberty and U.S. sovereignty.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Trump\u2019s order prohibits CBDCs, meaning the government can\u2019t create a digital version of the dollar directly controlled by the central bank. At the same time, the order promotes privately issued U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, with the goal of bolstering the dollar\u2019s dominance in global trade and digital finance.\n\nIn other words, Trump is signaling his commitment to keeping cryptocurrencies under a decentralized financial system.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Trump launched a memecoin, $TRUMP, days before his inauguration. The memecoin stood at a $6.84 billion valuation as of Thursday afternoon. Critics have warned that Trump\u2019s token erodes boundaries between the president\u2019s political and business interests, and some have argued it has the makings of a classic pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nPrevious administrations have approached the crypto world with caution due to concerns that it can easily be used in association with illicit and illegal activities, like ransomware payments and money laundering. One of the most prescient examples of the dangers of crypto is the downfall of crypto trading platform FTX, which exposed massive fraud, misappropriation of customer funds, and a lack of regulatory oversight.\n\nMany in the crypto industry argue that FTX\u2019s crash is exactly why clearer regulation designed for the industry is needed. And there are some companies, like Chainalysis, that have made strides in creating trust in crypto by providing compliance and investigation software and tracking virtual currencies."}
