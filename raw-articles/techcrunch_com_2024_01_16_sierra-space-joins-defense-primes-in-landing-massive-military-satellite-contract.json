The news, announced today, follows news from last week that Rocket Lab landed a similar contract for up to $515 million.\n\nThe award, as well as Rocket Lab\u2019s, shows that more and more companies are looking to take a slice of a market that until now had been the exclusive domain of defense primes: military satellites. Most recently, Sierra closed a $290 million Series B round that skyrocketed its valuation to $5.3 billion.\n\nThe 54 satellites will form part of the SDA\u2019s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a massive missile detection and tracking constellation in low Earth orbit that\u2019s being built and launched in \u201ctranches.\u201d The trio of contracts announced today is for 18 satellites each in the Tranche 2 Tracking Layer: L3Harris\u2019s award is worth $919 million; Lockheed Martin, $890 million; and Sierra Space, $740 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to welcome Sierra Space, a new entrant as a prime vendor on Team SDA, as we continue working with L3Harris and Lockheed Martin on Tranche 2,\u201d SDA director Derek Tournear said in a statement. \u201cThe marketplace is responding to the demand signals for our spiral development model. The agile response across the space industry is critically important as we deliver to the warfighter this no-fail mission capability of missile warning, missile tracking, and missile defence.\u201d\n\nThe 54 satellites will consist of 48 dedicated to missile detection and tracking and 6 to missile defense. All will be equipped with infrared sensors, though the sensors on the six birds dedicated to missile defense will be capable of generating what the SDA calls \u201cfire control-quality tracks,\u201d which are sensitive enough to guide an interceptor to bring down an aggressor\u2019s missile.\n\nWhile Lockheed and L3Harris have an established track record winning satellite manufacturing contracts with the SDA, this is the first award of this kind for Sierra Space. The latter company is best known for its Dream Chaser spaceplane and Orbital Reef private space station project, rather than satellite manufacturing at scale.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
