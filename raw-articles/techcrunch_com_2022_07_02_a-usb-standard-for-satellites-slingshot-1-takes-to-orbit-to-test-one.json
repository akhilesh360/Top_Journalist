Slingshot 1, a 12U CubeSat mission just launched via Virgin Orbit, is an attempt to make building and testing a new satellite as easy as plugging a new keyboard into your computer.\n\nTo say it\u2019s \u201cUSB for space\u201d is reductive\u2026 but not wrong. The team at the Aerospace Corporation that designed the new system makes the comparison itself, noting that the military has made several attempts to create just this with the Space Plug-and-Play Architecture (SPA), which became the Modular Open Network ARCHitecture (MONARCH), and the Common Payload Interface Standard (CoPaIS). But the approaches haven\u2019t taken off the way, say, the CubeSat standard has \u2014 which, by the way, Aerospace also pioneered.\n\nThe goal of Slingshot 1 is to create a standard satellite bus that\u2019s as adaptable and easy to use as USB or ATX, using open standards but also meeting all the necessary requirements for security, power and so on:\n\n[Slingshot] offers more agility and flexibility in satellite development through the use of modular, plug-and-play interfaces. These interfaces leverage open-sourced systems to avoid proprietary lock-ins that may stall development, as well as standardized interfaces for payloads that would not require a customized satellite bus. These interfaces set the power, command, control, telemetry, and mission data that may be required for payloads. Without a set of common standards, these payload-to-satellite bus requirements are driven by varying satellite bus manufacturers. Slingshot eliminates this uncertainty by reducing the number of requirements and complexity in the interface and creating an open payload interface standard called Handle.\n\nHow will it avoid the common trap encountered by would-be standard-standardizers, immortalized by XKCD: now there are N+1 standards?\n\nWell, leaving aside the pretty deplorable state of standards in the satellite world, if there can be said to be any, the team decided to base the whole thing on Ethernet, which underpins a huge amount of networking in the world already.\n\n\u201cBasing the Handle standard on Ethernet builds on the vast ecosystem of hardware and software tools developed for that very common interface, essentially taking the most common terrestrial system standard and migrating it for satellite use,\u201d said Dan Mabry, senior engineer specialist at Aerospace. \u201cWe\u2019ve tailored the network for low power, but still support gigabit per second communications between devices with no custom software development required to tailor the network for each new application.\u201d\n\nAnd as he put it when Aerospace wrote up Slingshot for its own purposes last year: \u201cWhen a payload plugs in it\u2019ll instantly be recognized and work, and any broadcast data will get to the spacecraft downlink without any tuning or tweaking of the software onboard. Furthermore, because it\u2019s an onboard network, that payload\u2019s data is seen by all the other payloads as well. Payloads can easily collaborate in real-time, and distributed smart sensors and processors are coupled by the basic architecture.\u201d\n\nCombine this with a power hub that can intelligently supply a variety of needs, and a modular enclosure that makes the whole thing look like the back of a well-organized gaming PC, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for plug and play that really makes things easy on the prospective designer.\n\nThe assembled Slingshot 1 setup without its outer enclosure.

Handle was key to a streamlined payload integration process on Slingshot 1 where we had a wide range of payloads with different requirements and it enabled us to be able to integrate the volume of payloads we did in a satellite about the size of a shoe box.\u201d\n\nOf course it\u2019s not enough to simply send up a bare-bones interface \u2014 imagine sending up a PC case with nothing in it. To see if it works, you need stuff attached, and fortunately there are a ton of experiments and capabilities Aerospace has been saving up since Slingshot\u2019s genesis in 2019:\n\nHandle \u2013 Plug-and-play payload electrical interface module\n\nSatCat5 \u2013 Onboard ethernet and network routing\n\nt.Spoon \u2013 Modular mechanical interface\n\nt.Spoon Camera \u2013 Plug-and-play camera module\n\nt.Spoon Processor \u2013 Zynq Ultrascale+ onboard processing\n\nStarshield \u2013 Onboard malware detection\n\nCoralReef \u2013 Coral Tensor Processing Unit\n\nSTarfish \u2013 Secure ARM Cortex-M33 onboard processing\n\nSDR \u2013 S-band Software-Defined Radio (SDR) downlink\n\nKeyspace \u2013 Cryptographic services for SmallSats\n\nLasercom \u2013 Next-gen space/ground lasercom downlink\n\nROESA \u2013 Using Internet of Things protocols to connect payloads\n\nVertigo \u2013 Reconfigurable attitude control system\n\nBlinker \u2013 GPS transponder for space traffic management\n\nHyper \u2013 SmallSat hydrogen peroxide thruster\n\nExoRomper \u2013 Artificial intelligence and machine learning testbed\n\nSome of these are more or less self-explanatory, like t.Spoon\u2019s various components, making up the core mechanical elements tying the whole thing together. And of course you need a nice software-defined radio downlink. But a tensor processing unit and machine learning testbed on a satellite? Internet of Things protocols? Cryptographic services?\n\nCG view of Slingshot expanding to show its components.

How do you make sure their communications remain secure? The same way you would on the ground, but adapted to the lightweight processing, limited-power, unusual interface of a spacegoing craft. Sure, secure processing and communications in space have been done before \u2014 but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a plug and play version where you can just click a check box and suddenly your payload is fully encrypted.\n\nSimilar is ExoRomper, which has an externally mounted camera hooked into the TPU. There\u2019s been a bit of AI in space already, but never a setup where you can say: oh sure you can add on cloud recognition to your satellite, it\u2019ll take up 2 watts, 20 cubic centimeters and 275 grams. This one in particular is set up to watch the satellite itself, looking at lighting conditions \u2014 something that seriously affect thermal loads and power handling. Why shouldn\u2019t your satellite have its own satellite, watching to make sure there\u2019s no hot spots on the solar cells?\n\nData will be coming in from Slingshot as it tests out its many components and experiments over the coming months. It could be the start of a new modular era for small satellites."}
