The disclosure coincided with the announcement that Klaviyo and Shopify will strengthen their existing partnership by making Klaviyo the recommended email product for Shopify\u2019s premium merchant plan, Shopify Plus, while granting Klaviyo early access to in-development Shopify features.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working closely with Shopify for years and this is a great next step,\u201d Klaviyo CEO Andrew Bialecki told TechCrunch via email. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with their product team and CEO many times \u2014 they\u2019re big believers in our mission of empowering creators and they have a lot of respect for the products we\u2019ve built and our customer-first, product-led culture. Shopify\u2019s been key to our growth and a great team to work with and we\u2019re excited that this will help us go faster in helping more of their customers.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2012, Boston-based Klaviyo \u2014 which TechCrunch has profiled extensively \u2014 integrates with existing platforms (e.g., Octane AI, Recharge) to automate the sending of emails and text messages to customers. Using Klaviyo, businesses can set up triggers for messages about abandoned carts, product recommendations and more, leveraging an array of templates and predictive analytics tools.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of competition in the marketing automation tech space (see Sendlane, Sendinblue and Cordial to name a few). But Klaviyo has done incredibly well for itself, reaching over 100,000 paying customers including Unilever, Dermalogica, Solo Stove and Citizen Watches.\n\nTo date, Klaviyo, which has over 1,000 employees, has raised around $775 million. As of May 2021, the startup was valued at $9.5 billion by investors including Sands Capital, Counterpoint Global, Accel and Summit Partners.\n\nFor Shopify, Klaviyo is the latest in a string of investments and acquisitions aimed at broadening the e-commerce platform\u2019s reach. In May, Shopify snapped up shipping logistics startup Deliverr for $2.1 billion \u2014 the largest purchase in Shopify\u2019s history \u2014 to launch an \u201cend-to-end\u201d logistics platform for merchants. Just this week, Shopify invested in Single, a music and video app used by many businesses on Shopify, following an equity pledge in CMS developer Sanity.\n\nTo the extent that they have a focus, Shopify\u2019s past year of investments have leaned in the direction of recommendations and martech. Last September, Shopify put money toward and entered into a partnership with Yotpo, which provides marketing tools and products for consumer sellers. The e-commerce giant more recently injected capital into Crossing Minds, a startup offering a platform that delivers \u201cpersonalized experiences\u201d ostensibly without using personal data.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Last month, the company laid off 10% of its workforce \u2014 about 1,000 employees \u2014 in what CEO and founder Tobi L\u00fctke described as a \u201cnecessary\u201d move in response to users pulling back on online orders and returning to old shopping habits. The company posted a $1.2 billion net loss for Q2 2022 and warned shareholders during a call last week to expect inflation to impact earnings throughout the remainder of the year."}
