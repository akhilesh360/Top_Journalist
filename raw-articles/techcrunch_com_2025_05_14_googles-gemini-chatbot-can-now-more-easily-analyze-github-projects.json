Users can connect GitHub to Gemini by clicking the \u201c+\u201d button in the prompt bar, selecting \u201cimport code,\u201d and pasting a GitHub URL.\n\nGemini Advanced now connects with @github, making it a more powerful coding assistant.\n\n\n\nDirectly connect to public or private GitHub repos to generate/modify functions, explain complex code, ask questions about your codebase, debug and more.\n\n\n\nClick the + button in the prompt bar,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EgItxk6hd7 \u2014 Google Gemini App (@GeminiApp) May 14, 2025\n\nA word of warning: AI models, including Google\u2019s, still struggle to code quality software. Code-generating AI tends to introduce security vulnerabilities and errors, owing to weaknesses in areas like the ability to understand programming logic. One recent evaluation of Devin, a popular AI coding tool, found that it could only complete three out of 20 programming tests.\n\nThe new GitHub integration arrives just a few days after OpenAI launched a GitHub connector for ChatGPT deep research, a tool that searches across the web and other sources to compile thorough research reports on a topic. AI companies, including Google and OpenAI, are moving quickly to ship new capabilities in an effort to make their products stand out in an increasingly crowded field.\n\nCase in point, OpenAI on Tuesday brought SharePoint and Microsoft OneDrive connectors to ChatGPT deep research."}
