While this is unlikely to spur real legislation (despite the House\u2019s new task force), it does act as a bellwether for how experts lean on this controversial issue.\n\nThe letter, signed by more than 500 people in and adjacent to the AI field at time of publishing, declares that \u201cdeepfakes are a growing threat to society, and governments must impose obligations throughout the supply chain to stop the proliferation of deepfakes.\u201d\n\nThey call for full criminalization of deepfake child sexual abuse materials (CSAM, aka child pornography) regardless of whether the figures depicted are real or fictional. Criminal penalties are called for in any case where someone creates or spreads harmful deepfakes. And developers are called on to prevent harmful deepfakes from being made using their products in the first place, with penalties if their preventative measures are inadequate.\n\nAmong the more prominent signatories of the letter are:\n\nJaron Lanier\n\nFrances Haugen\n\nStuart Russell\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nMarietje Schaake\n\nSteven Pinker\n\nGary Marcus\n\nOren Etzioni\n\nGenevieve smith\n\nYoshua Bengio\n\nDan Hendrycks\n\nTim Wu\n\nAlso present are hundreds of academics from across the globe and many disciplines. In case you\u2019re curious, one person from OpenAI signed, a couple from Google DeepMind, and none at press time from Anthropic, Amazon, Apple or Microsoft (except Lanier, whose position there is non-standard). Interestingly they are sorted in the letter by \u201cNotability.\u201d\n\nThis is far from the first call for such measures; in fact, they have been debated in the EU for years before being formally proposed earlier this month. Perhaps it is the EU\u2019s willingness to deliberate and follow through that activated these researchers, creators, and executives to speak out.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

If legislators decide to take on the issue, an unlikely event given it\u2019s an election year with a sharply divided Congress, they will have this list to draw from in taking the temperature of AI\u2019s worldwide academic and development community."}
