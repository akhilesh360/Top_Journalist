The deal details are undisclosed, and a representative declined to comment. Back in April, NODE announced it received a $25 million grant to \u201cbuild the future of digital art\u201d from investor Micky Malka and Becky Kleiner. The former is chair of the foundation.\n\nYuga Labs purchased CryptoPunks back in 2022 from Larva Labs amid the digital token craze that saw NFTs sell for millions of dollars. The highest-priced CryptoPunk NFT sold for nearly $24 million worth of crypto, according to the CryptoPunks website.\n\nThe markets have slowed since then, however. Malka said that CryptoPunks \u201csparked a cultural movement,\u201d and that NODE will \u201cfuture-proof this landmark work,\u201d to make it more accessible for people to engage with."}
