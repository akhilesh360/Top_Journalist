Now, developers can build Lenses using GPS, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), compass heading, and custom locations, allowing them to access geo-location data and create things like AR walking courses.\n\nThe update is primarily aimed at improving location-based experiences on Spectacles.\n\nSnap showcased a few examples that utilize the new capabilities, such as NavigatAR from Utopia Labs, which directs users with Snap Map Tiles by displaying glowing arrows to assist wearers in reaching their destinations.\n\nOther new platform features for Spectacles include the aforementioned hand-tracking capabilities, which detect grab gestures and when a user has a phone in their hands. Snap also now lets developers easily add a leaderboard to their Lenses for competition-focused experiences.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a new AR keyboard.\n\nImage Credits:Snap\n\nSpectacles are currently accessible only through Snap\u2019s developer program, which costs $99 per month.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
