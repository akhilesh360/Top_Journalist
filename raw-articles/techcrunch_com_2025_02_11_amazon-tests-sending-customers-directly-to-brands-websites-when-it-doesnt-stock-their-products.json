Now Amazon is doing the same thing online. The retailer announced on Tuesday the test of a new Amazon Shopping feature that will redirect shoppers to other brands\u2019 websites if they search in the app for a particular product that Amazon doesn\u2019t carry.\n\nIn the movie, the radical marketing strategy improved customer sentiment around Macy\u2019s \u2014 and helped cement its status as the best place to shop. Amazon likely hopes its move will do the same, especially in light of the increased competition from other online retailers, including Chinese e-commerce apps like Temu and Shein.\n\nThe retailer says the feature is only a beta test for now and will be activated for a subset of U.S. customers who perform searches in the Amazon Shopping app.\n\nIn the new experience, Amazon will show select products in its search results even if it doesn\u2019t sell them. It will link to the retailer\u2019s website so customers can click through and evaluate the product, pricing, and delivery options, and even make purchases directly from the brand itself. The product information shown on Amazon is pulled directly from the retailer\u2019s website and is refreshed regularly.\n\nThese links to outside retailers will be shown alongside other relevant products found in Amazon\u2019s own store, including those from its third-party sellers. Amazon says it will not be sharing users\u2019 personal information with the brand when they click links.\n\nWhen customers click links, they will be notified via a pop-up message saying \u201cYou\u2019re leaving Amazon,\u201d so they\u2019re not confused about where they\u2019re shopping from. Some of the brands Amazon may redirect to will offer Buy with Prime, a checkout service that lets Prime members transact on a retailer\u2019s website using their Amazon account and payment information. The service offers Amazon Prime\u2019s same fast delivery, easy returns, and customer support.\n\nHowever, Amazon tells TechCrunch that the experience won\u2019t only include brands offering Buy with Prime. While it couldn\u2019t share a count or name the exact brands that are part of the test, the retailer says they span a number of categories.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

They can also contact this email to opt out of inclusion. Amazon claims it will have no data about how customers interact with the brand\u2019s website after they exit Amazon\u2019s site using the in-app browser.\n\nThat may be so, but even the data about what brands trigger clicks could help inform Amazon about products to stock and which brands it should court.\n\nOver the past year, the retailer has added more premium and luxury brands to its lineup, including Clinique, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Oura Rings, Armani Beauty, Kate Spade New York, Kiehl\u2019s, and Dolce & Gabbana Beauty. On the flip side, it\u2019s also challenged Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop with its own low-priced products on Amazon Haul."}
