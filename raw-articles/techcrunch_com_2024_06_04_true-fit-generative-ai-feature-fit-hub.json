Now, the company is venturing into the generative AI space with \u201cFit Hub,\u201d a new tool that aims to improve the way online shoppers find clothing that fits their body type.\n\nSizing issues continue to be one of the main sources of friction among online consumers, with the average return rate for e-commerce at 17.6%. Many customers try to avoid returns by carefully examining product detail pages for size charts, descriptions, and customer reviews to gauge how the clothing will fit. With its latest tool, TrueFit focuses on helping consumers well-fitting clothes on the first try with minimal returns.\n\nFit Hub aims to be a less time-consuming solution as it consolidates all the information from product pages into one place to help shoppers quickly learn about an item and feel more confident that they\u2019re buying the right size. The AI analyzes the size chart, description, customer reviews, and sales and returns data. It can then determine if a size 16 shoppers should size down or if clothing is true to size for people who wear size 4.\n\nFor further personalization, users can create a True Fit account and share specific styles and brands they enjoy, among other preferences.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a \u201cFit Tips\u201d tool that provides fitting advice, like telling customers that a certain item fits best on people with short torsos.\n\nJessica Arredondo Murphy, True Fit co-founder and chief operating officer, told TechCrunch, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to the point where it\u2019s almost information overload when it comes to size and fit. On any given website, you could have up to five different forms of size and fit information\u2026 We have one centralized place where we can synthesize that guidance from across the product detail page, combine new insights with traditional advice, and then simplify size and fit understanding for all types of shoppers.\u201d\n\nFit Hub leverages several generative AI models \u2014 ChatGPT 4o, GPT Vision, Gemini 1.5 Pro Vision models, and various open-source models \u2014 to understand vision and text in real time. Copilot is used in a limited capacity.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For instance, \u201cShopper Insights\u201d collects data from past shoppers and offers insights such as whether a product is favored by a specific age group, height, and even bra size (depending on the product). It\u2019ll also feature a side-by-side diagram, allowing shoppers to visually compare the differences between petite, plus-size, and regular versions of the same product.\n\nAnother upcoming tool is called \u201cBrand Sizing,\u201d which will help frequent customers compare sizing to previous purchases from their favorite brand. For instance, the AI will cross-reference 200 past purchases of a shirt to 500 other tops from the same brand to determine if it\u2019s the \u201cusual sizing\u201d or if the shopper should size up or down.\n\nOn the long-term roadmap, True Fit is also building a generative AI chatbot to help shoppers discover products and ask specific questions, such as, \u201cWhat jeans fit better for people with muscular thighs?\u201d The feature is still in the early stages of development and is limited to 1 million products so far.\n\nTrue Fit recently collaborated with Shopify to bring its services to businesses and merchants of all sizes. The company previously only catered to large brands, so this means more companies will have access to its no-code size-and-fit solution."}
