In particular, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been quite vocal about how exactly he wants his company to lead the transformation.\n\nSpeaking onstage at Stripe\u2019s annual Sessions conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Zuckerberg laid out his plans to automate the entire ad industry with a black-box, end-to-end AI ad tool.\n\nA key component of such a product would entail putting thousands of AI-generated \u201ctest\u201d ads in front of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads users, said Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cThe basic end goal here is any business can come to us, say what their objective is \u2014 we get new customers to do this thing, or sell these things \u2014 tell us how much they\u2019re willing to pay to achieve those results, connect their bank account, and then we just deliver as many results as we can,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s kind of like the ultimate business results machine. I think it\u2019d be one of the most important and valuable AI systems that gets built.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg first described this hypothetical machine on Ben Thompson\u2019s Stratechery podcast last week, and \u2014 if built as Zuckerberg envisions it \u2014 it would have huge implications for the ad industry. During his Sessions appearance, Zuckerberg posited that while creative ad agencies would continue to exist were Meta to deploy this AI, small businesses might not \u201chave to start off with the creative\u201d and Meta could simply handle all of their advertising operations.\n\nIn fact, Zuckerberg asserted during Sessions that Meta\u2019s ad tools, several of which have generative AI capabilities, are sophisticated enough already that the company doesn\u2019t even recommend that customers specify the demographics they\u2019d like to target. Meta\u2019s tools can find interested users better than human marketers can, claimed Zuckerberg. The next logical step, he says, is trying to apply this data-driven optimization to the creative side.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be able to come up with, like, 4,000 different versions of your creative and just test them and figure out which one works best,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company more recently launched a social portal and dedicated app that spotlights generative AI content. Now, it appears yet another category of generative AI \u2014 ads \u2014 is poised to gunk up Meta\u2019s social media ecosystem.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear before that users are the product on Meta\u2019s platforms and advertisers the customers, it\u2019s about to become crystal. While testing AI-generated ads may deliver value for companies, it means users will have to suffer through yet more slop.\n\nThe ad industry isn\u2019t likely to take kindly to Zuckerberg\u2019s vision, either.\n\nThere\u2019s been significant backlash over the ethics of using generative AI in creative fields. In October 2024, more than 11,000 creators signed an open letter condemning the use of human-generated art to train AI systems. Creators have also filed lawsuits against companies developing AI art tools, such as Midjourney and Stability AI.\n\nTo be fair, there are just as many creators and advertising executives who believe AI tools won\u2019t threaten their livelihoods anytime soon. Johnny Hornby, founder of the ad agency The&Partnership, on Tuesday published an op-ed arguing that creating successful branding campaigns is still a uniquely human task.\n\nIn any event, it seems that Zuckerberg has a pretty clear idea of how he wants to automate the ad industry and fill Meta\u2019s feed with AI \u2014 whether ad agencies or users like it or not."}
