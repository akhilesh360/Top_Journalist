(That deal also features in a major antitrust complaint against Google\u2019s adtech over the pond, led by the U.S. State of Texas.)\n\nThe CMA did also open a probe of Google\u2019s ad-related Privacy Sandbox plan last year, triggered by complaints over its planned deprecation of tracking cookies to migrate to an alternative stack of ad targeting technologies \u2014 a development that remains under external monitoring after a settlement between Google and the regulator which looks, at very least, to have slowed the pace of any switch. (Google also recently revised its approach to push for topic-based ad targeting, rather than cohorts.)\n\nThe latest Google probe by the CMA focuses on what it describes as \u201cstrong\u201d positions Google holds in adtech intermediation, aka the adtech tech stack, which the regulator suspects could be distorting competition \u2014 since the tech giant owns the largest service provider in three key parts of the chain.\n\nThe parts where it\u2019ll be examining Google\u2019s dominance are: DSPs (aka demand side platforms which enable advertisers and media agencies to buy publishers\u2019 available ad space from many sources); ad exchanges (which provide the tech to automate the sale of publishers\u2019 ad inventory via real-time auctions); and publisher ad servers (which manage publisher inventory and determine which ad to show based on bids received from exchanges and/or direct deals between publishers and advertisers).\n\n\u201cThe CMA is assessing whether Google\u2019s practices in these parts of the ad tech stack may distort competition. These include whether Google limited the interoperability of its ad exchange with third-party publisher ad servers and/or contractually tied these services together, making it more difficult for rival ad servers to compete,\u201d the regulator wrote in a press release. \u201cThe CMA is also concerned that Google may have used its publisher ad server and its DSPs to illegally favour its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.\u201d\n\nGoogle has a dominant share across key parts of the adtech tech stack, as an earlier CMA market study established (see chart below). But its ad products have evolved and merged over the years, as well as undergoing some rebranding \u2014 such as when Google sought to move away from the DoubleClick brand back in 2018 \u2014 all of which makes what is already a complex and even opaque market structure even more difficult for outsiders to get a handle on.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

(Although a 2019 consultation, following publication of its preliminary report, featured breaking up the adtech giant as one of a number of potential remedies.)\n\nInstead, in the final market report the CMA opted to push for new powers so it could make pro-competition interventions to remedy structural problems attached to tech giants with strategic market power.\n\nBut, years on, the CMA is still waiting for the U.K. government to legislation to empower the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) \u2014 which started work in shadow form last year. And it looks likely to have years more to wait, as the government has not made rebooting the competition regime an immediate priority.\n\nHence the CMA resorting to flexing its existing powers by opening investigations into specific adtech practices.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s PR also reiterates that while it\u2019s waiting on the government to empower the DMU it will \u201cforge ahead using its existing powers in the tech sector\u201d \u2014 so there\u2019s a bit of a shot across Whitehall\u2019s bows to get on with it.\n\nOn the Google probe specifically, Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s CEO, said today that it\u2019s opening a new investigation as it\u2019s concerned Google is unfairly leveraging its dominant position to favor its own services \u2014 harming rivals, customers and consumers.\n\nIn the statement he added:\n\n\u201cWeakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind paywalls. It may also be raising costs for advertisers which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that we continue to scrutinise the behaviour of the tech firms which loom large over our lives and ensure the best outcomes for people and businesses throughout the UK.\u201d\n\nThe CMA also makes a point of noting that the investigation of Google\u2019s adtech practices will \u201cfurther consider\u201d the \u201csignificant issues\u201d and \u201cpossible solutions\u201d that its 2020 market study had identified for addressing market power in adtech.\n\nGoogle was contacted for comment on the latest CMA probe.\n\nIt told us it hasn\u2019t seen the full CMA complaint yet so can\u2019t respond in detail \u2014 but in a statement attributed to a spokesperson it said:\n\nAdvertising tools from Google and many competitors help websites and apps fund their content, and help businesses of all sizes effectively reach their customers. Google\u2019s tools alone have supported an estimated \u00a355 billion in economic activity for over 700,000 businesses in the UK and when publishers choose to use our advertising services, they keep the majority of revenue. We will continue to work with the CMA to answer their questions and share the details on how our systems work.\n\nThe European Union announced its own wide-ranging probe of Google\u2019s adtech practices last summer \u2014 and that investigation remains ongoing. But France\u2019s antitrust watchdog has already conducted its own investigation of Google\u2019s self-preferencing in adtech and, last summer, the national authority hit it with a $268 million penalty for a string of abuses.\n\nThe tech giant requested a settlement in France \u2014 proposing a series of interoperability commitments that the regulator accepted as part of its binding decision. So the country has been ahead of the pack on the adtech antitrust issue.\n\nAdtech ops are also subject to privacy scrutiny in Europe \u2014 where Google\u2019s lead data protection regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, has \u2014 since 2019 \u2014 had an enquiry open into its ad exchange, following complaints about the security of real-time bidding\u2019s processing of personal data.\n\nHowever the DPC is being sued for inaction over complaints that date back to 2018.\n\nOther EU privacy complaints about real-time bidding have focused on the validity of consent/legal basis for the mass processing of web users\u2019 data \u2014 and a major decision by Belgium\u2019s data protection authority earlier this year identified a laundry list of problems with an industry standard framework that could force some reform of certain privacy-hostile adtech practices."}
