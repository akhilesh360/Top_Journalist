Now it has become one of the highest fidelity methods available for viewing the body\u2019s smallest building blocks. It\u2019s also a key pillar of Gandeeva, a new biotech company that emerged from stealth on Monday with a $40 million Series A round. The company plans to combine this high-resolution imagery with a suite of machine learning tools to speed up the process of drug discovery.\n\n\u201cIt took about 15 years of dedicated effort to achieve this dream we had when we started: to literally visualize proteins in an electron microscope at atomic resolution. Once we and others showed this could be done, it was clear to me that this was the critical tool needed to transform and revolutionize drug discovery,\u201d co-founder and CEO Sriram Subramaniam told TechCrunch.\n\nGandeeva\u2019s thesis, he continues, is about creating a platform that can actually learn from the current advances in cryo-Em. The idea is that these high-resolution images can help reveal previously unseen pockets for drugs to bind to, if, we can find drugs that fit the bill.\n\n\u201cHaving the tool to dig for gold is one thing, but you need to know what to do with that \u2014 what product to convert it into. And in our case that\u2019s medicines for patients,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are lots of companies tackling the mammoth problem of drug discovery at the moment. Gandeeva\u2019s approach, put extremely bluntly, is that seeing is believing when it comes to finding druggable targets in the body.\n\nCountless scientific breakthroughs have been achieved by simply observing the world around us. But when it comes to the body\u2019s building blocks, this is impossible without specific microscope techniques. The leading technique in this field for decades has been X-ray crystallography, in which a scientist literally packs proteins or molecules together into a crystal and shoots X-rays at it, approximating its shape, size and orientation.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The upside of cryo-Em is that it doesn\u2019t require crystallization. Instead, the molecules are flash frozen, creating a 2D sheet, that\u2019s then shot with an electron gun. This sheet protects the biomolecule from the electrons and allows for the capture of detailed images. That sheet also allows for scientists to capture the motion of biomolecules, a process that\u2019s not possible with a crystal-encased structure.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s possible to obtain images of structures as small as two \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms across \u2014 that\u2019s one-tenth of a nanometer. (For reference, the width of one human hair is about 1 million \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms).\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that cryo-EM is in the midst of a boom. As Nature reported in February 2020, some scientists have predicted that more protein structures will be determined by cryo-EM than X-ray crystallography by 2024. It\u2019s becoming a bigger part of the scientific toolkit \u2014 despite the sometimes prohibitively expensive costs of microscopes and equipment needed to perform the technique \u2014 because resolution has vastly improved.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other developments in structural biology working in Gandeeva\u2019s favor. For one, advances in machine learning have made it possible to predict exactly how proteins fold.\n\nSpecifically, we\u2019ve seen the development of two AI engines capable of predicting how proteins fold: AlphaFold, developed by Alphabet-owned AI outfit DeepMind, and RoseTTAFold, developed at the University of Washington. While it used to take hours of lab work to determine protein structures, RoseTTAFold claims to be able to predict that structure in 10 minutes, on a regular gaming computer.\n\nSubramaniam has argued that these tools provide an unprecedented level of insight into protein structure and function, but that there will still be gaps to fill (for instance, there are some elements of the AI predictions that are lower confidence than others). Cryo-EM, he notes, allows scientists to zoom in on specific areas of a protein, or capture images of proteins in many different conformational states (think wiggles), perhaps filling those gaps.\n\n\u201cWe have this whole new revolution happening in AI, and I think everyone is wondering: what does this all mean? This combination of AI and cryo-EM, which was always Gandeeva\u2019s thesis, is really the ticket because it\u2019s not just experimental alone or prediction alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can [use] these AI-based understandings of structural biology and interactions and combine that with precision imaging at the highest speed at the right throughput.\u201d\n\nSo far, Gandeeva is aiming to prove that cryo-EM can actually be done quickly and easily outside of a government or university sponsored context. That\u2019s important, because much of Subramaniam\u2019s work in this field has come in those environments.\n\nSubramaniam spent the bulk of his career at the NIH, where he was chief of the biophysics section at the National Cancer Institute. From there he went on to found the the National Cryo-EM facility, a government-run lab. At the NIH, he hoped to get moving on Gandeeva\u2019s cryo-EM-based drug discovery platform, and realized that developing the lab alone would cost billions.\n\nAt that time, \u201cVCs had no interest in that kind of approach,\u201d he said. But the University of British Columbia did. He left the NIH to become chair of Cancer Drug Design at the university.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years that I\u2019ve been here, I set up this essentially to show that I could repeat what we did at the NIH. So at UBC, I was able to create a prototype and that\u2019s really what persuaded investors this could be done at speed,\u201d he said.\n\nHis proof-of-concept came in the form of a rapidly produced cryo-EM image of the Omicron variant\u2019s spike protein, published in Science.\n\nUltimately, though, Gandeeva isn\u2019t just packaging cryo-EM in hopes of taking pretty biological pictures \u2014 it\u2019s a research platform aimed to cut down the time it takes to create new drugs.\n\n\u201cWe do think that we can shave a lot of time off simply because of the power of looking at exactly where the drug binds, and what protein surfaces it targets. That kind of information is extremely powerful because it prevents you from following dead end pathways,\u201d Subramaniam said.\n\nThe company will have to prove that it can perform this technique at industrial speed and scale, and glean information that can\u2019t be found elsewhere. Gandeeva has a six-year lease on a facility outside of Vancouver, where Subramaniam plans to build out the functionality of his platform.\n\nInternally, the goal is to advance a few programs to prove that they can identify potential drug targets. Subramaniam said that if he had to guess, he\u2019ll likely start applying Gandeeva\u2019s platform to oncology \u2014 but that\u2019s not set in stone.\n\nThis round was led by Lux Capital and LEAPS by Bayer. The round includes participation from Obvious Ventures, Amgen Ventures, Amplitude Ventures and Air Street Capital. The company has raised $40 million to date."}
