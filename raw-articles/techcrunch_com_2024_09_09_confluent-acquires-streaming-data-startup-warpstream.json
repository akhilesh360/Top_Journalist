Confluent plans to use WarpStream\u2019s cloud-native solution to fill out its portfolio by offering a new service (Confluent WarpStream) that can sit in between its fully managed Confluent Cloud and self-managed Confluent Platform.\n\nAs Confluent co-founder and CEO Jay Kreps told me, he thinks that what sits in between those two existing models is what he calls the \u201cbring your own cloud\u201d (BYOC) model.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a set of people who want some self-managed piece of software. They\u2019re going to go around themselves,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a set of people who want a fully managed cloud. But in some of these organizations, there\u2019s a set of use cases that either have requirements around the data in their environment not being able to leave or just need a fair amount of customization that leaves them doing everything themselves, which is not ideal. So this kind of \u2018bring your own cloud\u2019 is like a nice middle position where you can have something that\u2019s like a cloud offering, but it could be in your environment with a fair amount of control.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Confluent\n\nWarpStream, Kreps said, built the right product for this market, and while Confluent could\u2019ve tried to adapt one of its products for these users, he didn\u2019t think that this approach would work well. \u201cWe feel this kind of completes the set of offerings. And this has been one of our beliefs for streaming: Since customers need it across such a broad set of use cases, you have to have the full portfolio of offerings if you really want to get all the streams of data and actually make it useful for customers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also noted that nobody wants to adopt a new protocol for different data streaming use cases. The market, for the most part, has standardized on Kafka, even if the underlying technology continues to evolve. That\u2019s true for WarpStream as well, which Kreps noted has done a good job establishing itself with users in the observability, logging and IoT spaces.\n\nImage Credits:Confluent\n\nConfluent also hopes that WarpStream will offer some of the customers who are using and managing their own open source Kafka systems an easy on-ramp onto its platforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited that the leader in the data streaming space has acquired WarpStream to offer next-gen BYOC to customers,\u201d said Richard Artoul, co-founder and CEO, WarpStream. \u201cTogether with Confluent, we will continue to ensure that Kafka-compatible data streaming is accessible to every organization.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In Monday\u2019s announcement, Artoul describes how Kreps reached out to him shortly after the company launched. \u201cOver the next few months we met with more people at Confluent to determine if there was a path forward for WarpStream to exist under the Confluent umbrella, and today we\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019ve found one,\u201d he writes.\n\nClearly, there was a path forward, and while the two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition, it\u2019s worth noting that WarpStream announced a $20 million funding round led by Greylock and Amplify Partners earlier this year. \u201cIt was a good deal for all involved,\u201d Kreps said."}
