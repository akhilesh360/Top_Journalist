Light (295 grams) and affordable ($420), the virtual reality headset released by the ByteDance-owned manufacturer was expected to drive adoption in a market inaccessible to Meta.\n\nThe odds were against Pico. Its sales have been sluggish, and this week, Pico, which was acquired by the TikTok parent two years ago, initiated a fresh round of layoffs.\n\nThis week, Pico held an internal meeting announcing a major reorganization. A person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that \u201ca few hundred\u201d employees were let go, leaving Pico with \u201cunder 2,000\u201d people.\n\nEven after the layoff, Pico, as it stands today, has a significantly bigger headcount than the team of 200-300 when it was acquired. The shakeup suggests that Pico is regrouping to slash costs and pursue more sustainable growth after a period of aggressive expansion.\n\nIn a statement, a Pico spokesperson said that the unit was restructuring to focus more on \u201chardware and core technologies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe frequently assess our business needs and make adjustments to strengthen our organization and better align our teams with company goals,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nFrequent assessments are indeed needed at a time when China\u2019s post-COVID economic recovery misses expectations. China\u2019s VR shipments shrank by 56% year-over-year in the first half of 2023, according to market research firm Counterpoint.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For one, Chinese consumers are spending less amid a weakening economy. To weather the tepid economic recovery, Pico has scaled back its marketing investments, leading to a smaller shipment target, according to Counterpoint\u2019s analysis.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the lack of high-quality VR content that\u2019s needed to drive mass adoption. VR technology is still in its infant stage of development, with hardware awaiting some meaningful advancements. At a time when businesses are tightening their belt, it only seems logical for Pico to focus on improving its hardware rather than investing heavily in content creation.\n\nFurther adding to its sales pressure is that in China, youth gaming \u2014 arguably one of the largest VR consumer categories \u2014 is \u201cheavily regulated, with complicated content vetting processes and legally capped screen time,\u201d suggested Gavin Newton-Tanzer, host of mixed-reality conference AWE Asia. Regulatory barriers also \u201ccomplicated\u201d Pico\u2019s U.S. launch, said Newton-Tanzer.\n\n\u201cPico has strong fundamentals, but luck and timing conspired against them, so some degree of restructuring was inevitable due to lackluster consumer sales,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhile I firmly believe consumer VR in China will have its breakout moment, it just won\u2019t be in 2023. In this context, Pico\u2019s choice to bide its time and focus on hardware makes sense: they\u2019ll continue to make progress in the B2B market while keeping options open for another run at the consumer market in the future.\u201d"}
