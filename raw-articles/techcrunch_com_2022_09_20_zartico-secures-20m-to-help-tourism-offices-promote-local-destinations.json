Darren Dunn and Jay Kinghorn experienced this firsthand \u2014 Dunn as a sales executive at various travel companies including FarePortal.com and Jay as an associate managing director at Utah\u2019s office of tourism.\n\n\u201cDestinations around the world [are] relying on outdated quarterly and yearly reports to make critical decisions on marketing allocation, product mix, and coordination with stakeholders such as hoteliers, attractions and local government officials,\u201d CEO Sarah Lehman told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during the pandemic and the industry has not fully recovered. The industry has to provide attractive career paths to allow people to build their careers and have long-term stability.\u201d\n\nTo attempt to inject some data and digitization into tourism operations, Dunn and Kinghorn co-founded Zartico, a platform that provides analytics and visualizations to destination management organizations, or DMOs \u2014 government-affiliated tourism boards that promote locations as travel destinations. In a sign business is performing at expectations, Zartico today announced that it raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Arthur Ventures with participation from Peterson Partners, the proceeds from which Lehman says will be put toward R&D and hiring.\n\nZartico\u2019s platform ingests geolocation, spend and event data from partners \u2014 Lehman wouldn\u2019t say which vendors \u2014 and overlays it on top of other data streams (e.g. from customer relationship management systems and jobs boards). Using it, customers can see where visitors to a location migrate and move at the street level and track the tourism effects on locally owned businesses.\n\nOn the analytics side, Zartico uses AI to predict activity, like the volume of visitors to a certain area, and to extract mentions of travel destinations from unstructured text (e.g. social media posts and web pages). These extractions can be used to help customers develop new travel products line and fine-tune their marketing campaigns, Lehman says.\n\n\u201cDMOs don\u2019t have first-party data, like customer email addresses or shipping addresses, nor do they have conversion data to explicitly connect marketing initiatives to sales and revenue growth,\u201d Lehman said. \u201cAdvancements in our integrated data model tighten alignment between our core data sets [for DMOs,] making for faster, more accurate and easier self-service insights across spending, movement, marketing and web data sets.\u201d\n\nZartico\u2019s geolocation tracking might not sit well with all privacy advocates \u2014 or tourists for that matter. After all, it was just in August that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission alleged one data broker, Kochava, sold to clients the precise locations of U.S. consumers, including at therapists\u2019 offices and homeless shelters. A seminal piece from The New York Times showed the various ways location data \u2014 typically from smartphones \u2014 can be used to track a person\u2019s movements, especially when correlated with publicly available records.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

She claims that the company doesn\u2019t conduct analytics on individuals or store personally identifiable data, doesn\u2019t allow use of its data by law enforcement and will terminate a client if Zartico learns of \u201cdishonest\u201d or illegal practices on their part.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t allow use of our data to target advertising to people below the legal age \u2014 for example, alcohol and casinos \u2014 or to create audiences for locations primarily visited by children such as preschools and playgrounds,\u201d Lehman added. \u201cWe [also ] don\u2019t allow use of our data for employment, credit, health care or insurance purposes, and we don\u2019t allow use of our data to target vulnerable or sensitive communities \u2014 for example, by political, religious or sexual orientation \u2014 or to identify those within sensitive areas (e.g., conflict zones, protests, religious sites, clinics, etc.) or to places.\u201d\n\nZartico launched in March 2020 \u2014 one week prior to most of the world shutting down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the inopportune timing and competition from rivals, including Arrivalist, Rove and Datafy (which specialize in data visualization and reporting) and Placer.ai (which tracks people movement), Lehman says that Zartico has grown to more than 188 customers in less than three years. All clients are government entities \u2014 think cities, counties and visitors bureaus \u2014 who\u2019ve actively contributed to Zartico\u2019s $10 million in annual revenue.\n\nLehman has grand plans for the future, including using machine learning to create behavioral models that prevent \u201cover-tourism\u201d in particular destinations. Zartico is also eyeing new markets, she says \u2014 chiefly sports venues, municipalities and airports \u2014 as it grows headcount over the next six months from 61 employees to more than 100.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic heightened the world\u2019s understanding and appreciation of the impact of the visitor economy. This experience thrust the need for real-time decision making to the forefront,\u201d Lehman said. \u201cNo longer satisfied with rearview mirrors, the destination industry is looking for, and deserves, forward-looking tools. Zartico is keenly positioned to lead the technical transformation due to the rapid pivot towards the use of high-frequency big data sets to provide situational awareness.\u201d\n\nZartico has raised a total of $24.5 million in capital to date, inclusive of the Series A tranche closed today."}
