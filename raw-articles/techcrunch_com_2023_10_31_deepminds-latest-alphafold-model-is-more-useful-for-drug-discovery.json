Since then, DeepMind has improved on the system, releasing an updated and more capable version of AlphaFold \u2014 AlphaFold 2 \u2014 in 2020.\n\nAnd the lab\u2019s work continues.\n\nToday, DeepMind revealed that the newest release of AlphaFold, the successor to AlphaFold 2, can generate predictions for nearly all molecules in the Protein Data Bank, the world\u2019s largest open access database of biological molecules.\n\nAlready, Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind focused on drug discovery, is applying the new AlphaFold model \u2014 which it co-designed \u2014 to therapeutic drug design, according to a post on the DeepMind blog, helping to characterize different types of molecular structures important for treating disease.\n\nNew capabilities\n\nThe new AlphaFold\u2019s capabilities extend beyond protein prediction.\n\nDeepMind claims that the model can also accurately predict the structures of ligands \u2014 molecules that bind to \u201creceptor\u201d proteins and cause changes in how cells communicate \u2014 as well as nucleic acids (molecules that contain key genetic information) and post-translational modifications (chemical changes that occur after a protein\u2019s created).\n\nPredicting protein-ligand structures can be a useful tool in drug discovery, DeepMind notes, as it can help scientists identify and design new molecules that could become drugs.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Docking methods require specifying a reference protein structure and a suggested position on that structure for the ligand to bind to.\n\nWith the latest AlphaFold, however, there\u2019s no need to use a reference protein structure or suggested position. The model can predict proteins that haven\u2019t been \u201cstructurally characterized\u201d before, while at the same time simulating how proteins and nucleic acids interact with other molecules \u2014 a level of modeling that DeepMind says isn\u2019t possible with today\u2019s docking methods.\n\n\u201cEarly analysis also shows that our model greatly outperforms [the previous generation of] AlphaFold on some protein structure prediction problems that are relevant for drug discovery, like antibody binding,\u201d DeepMind writes in the post. \u201cOur model\u2019s dramatic leap in performance shows the potential of AI to greatly enhance scientific understanding of the molecular machines that make up the human body.\u201d\n\nThe newest AlphaFold isn\u2019t perfect, though.\n\nIn a whitepaper detailing the system\u2019s strengths and limitations, researchers at DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs reveal that the system falls short of the best-in-class method for predicting the structures of RNA molecules \u2014 the molecules in the body that carry the instructions for making proteins.\n\nDoubtless, both DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs are working to address this."}
