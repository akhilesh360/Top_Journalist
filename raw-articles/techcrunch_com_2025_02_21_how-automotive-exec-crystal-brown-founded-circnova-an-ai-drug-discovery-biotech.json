Circular RNA is a relatively newly discovered class of such structures that form a circle rather than a strand. It regulates critical biological processes, and the hope is that therapies based on these molecules will be able to target complex health issues.\n\nCircNova has developed a \u201cproprietary AI engine that allows us to identify, design, and then produce novel, non-coding, circular RNAs,\u201d Brown told TechCrunch.\n\nIt\u2019s an AI engine similar to Google\u2019s DeepMind AlphaFold, in that it also uses deep learning AI \u2014 not some kind of large language model \u2014 to generate and analyze new circular RNA for therapeutic use.\n\nCircNova has not only its NovaEngine, which it says is the first in the world to be able to predict circular RNA structures, but it also has a wet lab. That means its AI engine produces the actual physical molecules themselves, which can then be validated and researched in collaboration with the University of Michigan, Brown said.\n\n\u201cWe can reverse engineer. We can go from sequence to structure. We can go from structure to sequence when developing the molecule,\u201d she says.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Investor William Grenawitzke is chief business officer and the startup\u2019s third co-founder.\n\nLessons from a failed startup\n\nBrown seems like an unlikely founder of such a company because until about seven years ago, her career had been in the automotive manufacturing industry.\n\nShe thought she was climbing the ladder to become a \u201cC-suite automotive executive\u201d when a friend of hers introduced her to a CEO running a life science startup. The startup CEO was looking for a business manager.\n\nCurious, Brown offered to keep the books part-time, which evolved into her bringing business tactics from auto factories to help the startup, like overhauling their business contracts.\n\nShe peppered the team with questions about the science until some of her friends told her she should quit automotive and work full-time in biotech.\n\n\u201cI was like, no one\u2019s gonna take me seriously. I\u2019ve never studied biology. I studied poli sci and women\u2019s studies,\u201d she recalls.\n\nBut she made the leap anyway, taking a massive pay cut from her well-paying six-figure job to what amounted to intern-level pay. She learned about startups, raised money, and worked her way up to director of operations. The company went public, giving her a healthy enough payout to buy a house, she said.\n\nFlushed with success, she launched a biotech startup of her own, a contract research lab.\n\nShe raised money, then made all the classic first-founder mistakes. \u201cI hired people too quickly. I opened up my lab,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo years in, her startup burned through its funds, and she knew she had to shutter it. It broke her heart and her bank account. She even lost her house, she recalled.\n\nBut she had gained a stellar reputation in Michigan\u2019s tight-knit startup community and Brown recalls that VCs told her, \u201cYou\u2019re a good founder anyway.\u201d Several said they\u2019d be open to funding her next idea.\n\nKnowing she would soon be available for a new venture, Deangelo began sending her scientific material on circular RNA. He had an idea for how to use it with AI drug discovery.\n\n\u201cHe started sending me, literally every morning at 5:30 \u2026 five to 10 articles,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even shut the other company down all the way.\u201d\n\nBut she studied up and grew convinced this idea could work. They founded CircNova in May 2023.\n\n\u201cI went into it very cautiously, throwing just a few things at the wall. What can I do with the $15,000 grant to get it started?\u201d\n\nThat first expenditure developed the startup\u2019s first process and another $25,000 from a National Science Foundation grant led to the first patent application.\n\nShe began to split her time between Michigan and Boston, near her customers and wish-list customers like Moderna and Pfizer.\n\nAs for betting on Brown again, VCs like Nia Batts, a general partner at Union Heritage Ventures, had no problem with it.\n\n\u201cWe are no stranger to the resilience that is needed when you engage in the journey of entrepreneurship,\u201d Batts said, adding that she knew she wanted to back this new venture \u201cthe moment\u201d she met Brown and heard about the idea.\n\nThis $3.3 million seed round was led by diversity-focused VC South Loop Ventures and includes investment from Dug Song, Union Heritage, Michigan Rise, Invest Detroit, Kalamazoo Forward Ventures, and SPARK Capital."}
