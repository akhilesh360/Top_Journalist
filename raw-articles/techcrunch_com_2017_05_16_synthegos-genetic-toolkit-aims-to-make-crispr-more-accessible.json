That\u2019s the goal, though, and Synthego is one of the companies pursuing it by creating a sort of ready-made CRISPR sandbox to start new researchers off.\n\n\u201c80 percent of users getting into CRISPR have never done genetic engineering at all. So we simplified the process,\u201d said Synthego founder Paul Dabrowski on stage at Disrupt today. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful interface\u2026 but there\u2019s a lot of heavy lifting in the background.\u201d\n\nIf you want to use CRISPR, you need the genome of the animal you want to use, the DNA code gene you\u2019re targeting, and a corresponding piece of RNA that leads the genetic scissors to the right location. And it\u2019s as difficult to share and compare with others as it is to do in the first place.\n\nDabrowski compared it to GPS. It isn\u2019t much use to the average person if it\u2019s just a readout of code. You need a compass, maps, images, and an interface if you want it to be useful. The genetic engineering equivalent of that metadata, if you can imagine that, is what Synthego wants to provide, and empower would-be researchers in the process.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious benefit of the Synthego platform is its selection of genomes: 100,000 of them, belonging to 9,000 species. So if you\u2019re a small research outfit looking to test the effect of an insecticide on local amphibians, you may not have to use up time and money sequencing them.\n\n\u201cYou can design CRISPR for pretty much any organism out there,\u201d Dabrowski said with evident pride. Now, to be clear, a lot of that list is bacteria. I couldn\u2019t find any bears, but I did find dogs.\n\nOnce you specify the gene you\u2019re looking to disable (no adding genes yet \u2014 that\u2019s more difficult and more ethically dubious), Synthego generates the \u201cguide\u201d RNA strand needed to take the CRISPR molecules to their targets. Or, if you already have the guide RNA, the platform can double check it for accuracy \u2014 and then you can order a few strands right there.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Part of that would also be from the ability to easily share your design or compare with existing work. Who knows what techniques or discoveries might help build a new vaccine or treatment, if only the data pertaining to these small-scale experiments were more liquid.\n\nOn stage, Dabrowski described the genesis of the company, which started just last year and is already shipping RNA to 35 countries. He and his brother both worked at SpaceX, and both left at the same time in 2009. (Not 2016, as this paragraph read originally \u2014 that\u2019s just when Synthego was founded.)\n\n\u201cThere was an opportunity to apply a pure engineering, agile software mindset to biotech here,\u201d Dabrowski recalled. (Unfortunately, \u201cElon wasn\u2019t necessarily the happiest.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThere are applications in therapeutics and in biofuels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to build out all the informatics behind the scenes, and over time we\u2019ll become more of a software company.\u201d\n\nBut for now he and Synthego are definitely focused on biotech: Dabrowski expects \u201can unprecedented level of understanding\u201d when it comes to biology and genetics over the next decade, and demand for free, accessible tools like this one will go through the roof."}
