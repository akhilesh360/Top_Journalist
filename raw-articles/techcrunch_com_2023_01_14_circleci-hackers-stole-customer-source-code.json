But a stolen session token allows an intruder to gain the same access as the account holder without needing their password or two-factor code. As such, it can be difficult to differentiate between a session token of the account owner, or a hacker who stole the token.\n\nCircleCi said the theft of the session token allowed the cybercriminals to impersonate the employee and gain access to some of the company\u2019s production systems, which store customer data.\n\n\u201cBecause the targeted employee had privileges to generate production access tokens as part of the employee\u2019s regular duties, the unauthorized third party was able to access and exfiltrate data from a subset of databases and stores, including customer environment variables, tokens, and keys,\u201d said Rob Zuber, the company\u2019s chief technology officer. Zuber said the intruders had access from December 16 through January 4.\n\nZuber said that while customer data was encrypted, the cybercriminals also obtained the encryption keys able to decrypt customer data. \u201cWe encourage customers who have yet to take action to do so in order to prevent unauthorized access to third-party systems and stores,\u201d Zuber added.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

LastPass confirmed in December that its customers\u2019 encrypted password vaults were stolen in an earlier breach. LastPass said the intruders had initially compromised an employee\u2019s device and account access, allowing them to break into LastPass\u2019 internal developer environment.\n\nUpdated headline to better reflect the customer data that was taken."}
