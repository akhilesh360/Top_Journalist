Today, one of the companies hoping to make a killing on that shift is announcing some funding and an M&A move to cement its place in that new economy.\n\nMavrck, which operates a platform for brands and media companies to source and engage with influencers for marketing campaigns, has raised another $135 million, and with some of that it\u2019s scooping up Later, a startup that first made its name with a social media scheduling tool for Instagram (its original name was Latergramme), but has since diversified into other social platforms like Pinterest, TikTok and LinkedIn, a Linkin.bio service, and analytics for the creator to track engagement and other metrics.\n\nThe Linkin.bio service alone is an interesting asset to pick up: Linktree, a big competitor in that space, just last month raised $110 million at a $1.3 billion valuation. (The financial terms of the Later acquisition are not being disclosed.)\n\nCanadian startup Later hadn\u2019t raised much money (less than $2 million, per Crunchbase) but it was already an influence in the influencer world: it\u2019s been around since 2014, and the Linkin.bio service (launched in 2016) has seen 2 billion+ pageviews, with nearly 7 million creators and small business using Later\u2019s wider product suite for social content scheduling and analytics. Mavrck for its part says that it works with some 5,000 marketers across 500 consumer brands to connect with some 3 million creators, paying out over $200 million to date.\n\nMavrck and Later will operate independently for now but there will also be more integration: for a start, the Linkin.bio click/engagement analytics will now appear in the Mavrck dashboard.\n\nThis latest equity investment is coming from a single investor, Summit Partners, which also was the sole investor when Mavrck raised $120 million only four months ago, in December last year. That and Linktree\u2019s valuation both speak to how heated the so-called creator economy is right now, although Mavrck isn\u2019t adding more fuel to that fire by disclosing its own valuation today.\n\nLike it or not (and despite the viral buzz that sometimes feels inescapable, many do not) the creator economy is a fascinating force in the world of marketing, social media and, to be honest, the consumer internet overall. Social media platforms, both those that are mainstream but also a lot focusing on particular interests or demographics, collectively have billions of users now (over 4.2 billion), and some argue they are the engine of the consumer internet today.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Sometimes it\u2019s engaging with friends, but increasingly it\u2019s getting a look into lives of people who you don\u2019t really know at all, who create content that\u2019s entertaining or thought-provoking, or annoying but engaging anyway. They become the glue for how people use services like Instagram. Your friends might not post all the time, or be that interesting, but you can always count on following some key and reliable creators to keep the timeline humming, and when you don\u2019t have that worked out already, Instagram (or another platform) is ready and willing to suggest content and people to follow.\n\nThat in turn becomes prime real estate for marketing and advertising \u2014 not least at a time when more standard advertising and marketing formats are under the gun over how data is tracked across the internet. People have gotten less happy about all that tracking, and regulators have followed; opting out of it all is possible in many (not all) places but that then means the format is less valuable for the ad buyers and publishers. Strategic placement of products or services with influencers, however, circumvents all that.\n\nIt is for this reason that Mavrck and companies like it believe that while some adtech and martech plays will look to incorporate more tools on their platforms, to help media buyers engage with that enconomy as part of their bigger spend, it\u2019s likely to be a big enough opportunity financially \u2014 and operationally and culturally \u2014 to remain a salient enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe creator economy is growing fast enough that it will be a standalone solution,\u201d CEO and co-founder Lyle Stevens said in an interview. He noted that the overall space has grown more than 40% in the last year and that while there are some 50 million creators out in the world today, they project around 1 billion people will identify as creators by 2030. \u201cThe majority of the middle class will be creators and they will be the focal point,\u201d he added. \u201cFor brands, [connecting with them] won\u2019t be a nice to have but a necessity to stay relevant.\u201d Brand spend on average has gone up by 114% since 2020, he noted, another proof point of the growth.\n\nThat will also inevitably spill out beyond social, too, which may well also find itself over time potentially also falling out of vogue. (Hard to believe but you never know.) Stevens sees currents in VR, for example, \u201cwill change the landscape dramatically.\u201d We\u2019ve also seen multiple startups targeting creators with the ability to build gaming experiences as another area where creators may extend their own brands and influence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a phenomenal platform designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs to manage their digital marketing, commerce, and customer relationships all in one place. Our notable scale is a result of the commitment we\u2019ve placed on our role within that ecosystem,\u201d said Roger Patterson, co-founder and CEO of Later, in a statement. \u201cLater\u2019s leading technology paired with Mavrck\u2019s enterprise social proof platform will expand on that value even further. Together we\u2019ll nurture a symbiotic relationship between creators and brands, helping both to drive meaningful results to grow their businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we believe Later and Mavrck can empower both sides of this ecosystem \u2013 content creators and the brands that seek to harness their influence \u2013 with solutions and at a scale not yet seen in the creator economy,\u201d added Michael Medici, MD at Summit Partners. \u201cWe look forward to working with Lyle, Roger and the entire team in their mission to solve a significant industry pain point for creators and marketers \u2013 and ultimately drive better business outcomes for both.\u201d"}
