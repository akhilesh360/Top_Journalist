The company says that the tool can curate \u201ccustom,\u201d AI-generated videos that \u201cshowcase a product\u2019s features\u201d at no additional cost.\n\n\u201c[Videos from Video Generator] leverage Amazon\u2019s unique retail insights to vividly bring a product story to life in ways that are relevant to customers,\u201d Amazon writes in a blog post.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon Ads VP Jay Richman said that Video Generator, which is currently in beta for select U.S. advertisers (and specifically for Sponsored Brands campaigns), will be fine-tuned over the next several months ahead of a wider release.\n\n\u201cVideo Generator is another meaningful innovation that leverages generative AI to inspire creativity and deliver more value for both advertisers and shoppers,\u201d Richman said. \u201cWe are hard at work delivering generative AI applications that empower advertisers to craft visually stunning, high-performing ads.\u201d\n\nA related new capability announced today, live image, generates few-seconds-long, animated GIFs from a still frame. Also in limited beta, it\u2019s a part of Image generator, Amazon\u2019s AI-powered image generation suite for marketers.\n\nAmazon didn\u2019t provide sample footage from Video Generator, and it initially revealed very few technical details about the tool and live image.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

They\u2019re automatically generated \u201caround\u201d a seed product image \u2014 \u201cinspired by the product and its details,\u201d the spokesperson said \u2014 and take up to five minutes to create. Users get four variations to choose from.\n\nVideo Generator outputs seem to follow the same basic formula: Two scenes with headlines (e.g. \u201cNourishing Lavender Moisturizer\u201d), background music, and a call to action. The font and soundtrack can be customized, as well as the brand logo that appears in the upper-right-hand corner of the frame.\n\nAmazon\u2019s expansion into generative video comes as other players release their own video-generating tech. Startups Runway and Luma launched generative video APIs this month, and Google says that it\u2019s beginning to integrate its flagship video model, Veo, into YouTube Shorts. Elsewhere, Adobe promised that video generation would come to its Creative Suite platform by the end of the year, and OpenAI is expected to roll out its technology, Sora, in some capacity this fall.\n\nAs with all generative AI systems, there are risks to using these tools.\n\nVideo-generating models are trained on a vast number of examples of videos to \u201clearn\u201d the patterns in these videos to generate new clips. Some vendors train models on copyrighted videos without obtaining permission from the owners or creators, and, when these models \u201cregurgitate\u201d copyrighted stills, it exposes users of the models to IP lawsuits.\n\nAmazon is one of several companies that has said it\u2019ll protect customers accused of violating copyright with media generated by its models, in keeping with its indemnification policy. We\u2019ve asked the company if Video Generator and live image are also covered under that policy.\n\nHowever the legal battles shake out, one thing\u2019s becoming clear: Generative AI threatens to upend the film and television industry as we know it. A 2024 study commissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that by 2026, more than 100,000 U.S.-based entertainment jobs will be disrupted by generative AI.\n\nUpdated 9/19 at 4 p.m. Pacific: Added technical details about Video Generator.\n\n\n\n"}
