But this time, the Heidelberg-based company is acquiring more than clients.\n\nWhile terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, TechCrunch has exclusively learned from Getsafe CEO Christian Wiens that deineStudienfinanzierung will continue operating as a standalone business and that all of its team \u2014 \u201cabout 10 people\u201d \u2014 will continue to be employed after the acquisition.\n\nIn practice, deineStudienfinanzierung will keep on helping students apply online for publicly subsidized loans offered by its partner, German state bank KfW. This has been the startup\u2019s core focus ever since it pivoted away from also facilitating grant applications; all in all, it has assisted some 200,000 students in receiving over \u20ac1 billion in study financing since its creation.\n\nIf this amounts to less than \u20ac5,000 per student, it is because demand for student loans in Germany is different from what you may know, Wiens explained.\n\n\u201cStudent loans are the second most popular form of external student financing in Germany after [grants]. Unlike in the U.S., universities in Germany are largely tuition-free, which means that student loans are generally used to cover living expenses. Therefore, the average student loan amount is much lower in Germany than in the U.S.\n\nCOVID boosted demand for student loans because many students could not perform their side jobs due to the lockdowns (e.g., working in bars and restaurants). Many lost their main source of income overnight and had to turn to alternative ways to cover their living expenses. The financing volume has returned to previous levels since.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Instead, both are bringing a digital-first approach that aims to connect more organically with young people.\n\nOverlapping targets\n\nDespite plans to keep things separate, Getsafe is very much hoping that there will be synergies between the two businesses that go beyond their shared vision. \u201cWith deineStudienfinanzierung, we are now a relevant fintech player for students,\u201d Wiens said.\n\nFor Getsafe, this is an opportunity to get acquainted with its future clients before they even think of talking to a broker. On average, it takes about two years for students who obtain a loan on deineStudienfinanzierung to secure their first job \u2014 and Getsafe is here for it.\n\nIn a country where Contents or Renters insurance is not a compulsory product, entering the job market is a more common trigger for getting insurance than renting an apartment, Wiens said. \u201cWe realized that to become their insurer of choice, we must think one step ahead.\u201d\n\nGetsafe CEO thinks that deineStudienfinanzierung\u2019s users may be even more sensitive to financial risk than the average first-time employee. \u201cWhen you take out a loan and start repaying it after you start your first job, you are more conscious of the fact that you rely on your income. So this becomes a natural trigger to consider, for example, income protection insurance.\u201d (This is one of the policies that Getsafe offers, alongside contents and personal liability insurance.)\n\nWhen asked whether insurance was a better fit for deineStudienfinanzierung to leverage its user base than banking, its founder, Bastian Krautwald, replied affirmatively.\n\n\u201cThe issue with banking is that most customers already have a bank account from an early age. By the time customers apply for a student loan, the barriers to switch are quite high. However, with insurance, it is different. It is not uncommon for young people to deal with insurance for the first time in their mid-twenties,\u201d Krautwald told TechCrunch.\n\nThis was a loaded question: Krautwald also co-founded Wajve, later known as OWWN, a banking product targeted at deineStudienfinanzierung\u2019s customers and target audience. But the fintech offering never made it out of its testing phase, with OWWN instead partnering up with neobank N26 to secure a special discount for its beta users and those on its waiting list.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nOWWN, Wajve and deineStudienfinanzierung didn\u2019t only share a CEO; they shared a parent company, FiRec GmbH, which raised \u20ac5 million in funding from investors including EQT Ventures, 468 Capital and finleap, as well as German business angels. Getsafe has now acquired FiRec in its entirety, while Krautwald will remain in his role as CEO of deineStudienfinanzierung.\n\n\u201cWe expect deineStudienfinanzierung to grow solidly and profitably as a standalone business this year,\u201d Wiens said. \u201cHowever, short-term revenue targets are not our primary goal, as this acquisition has mainly strategic value to us to better understand and access our target customers when they graduate.\u201d\n\nWill there be more strategic acquisitions in Getsafe\u2019s near future? \u201cWe are currently not actively looking for targets, but with two acquisitions under our belt, we are ready to explore and pursue opportunities quickly when they arise,\u201d Wiens said.\n\nWe won\u2019t hold our breath for it, but we\u2019ll keep closer track of another hint that Getsafe gave in its press release: that it is looking to \u201cexpand further to serve even more European markets\u201d than the four countries where it already operates."}
