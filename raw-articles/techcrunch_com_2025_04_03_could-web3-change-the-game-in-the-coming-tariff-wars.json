The claim may well be bold \u2014 and typical of many such bold claims made by other web3 startups. However, Watr\u2018s platform is already being used to validate commodities by large mining companies and auto manufacturers, so there may be more to the claim than meets the eye.\n\nCreated by former Shell, BP, and JP Morgan executives, the company is headed by Maryam Ayati, who lead global origination and investment at Shell Trading \u2014 so she ought to know what she\u2019s talking about. Watr counts investors from a syndicate of thus-far unnamed crypto VCs and commodity executives, but TechCrunch has seen evidence to suggest that it has several millions of dollars in backing already, and a number of, as yet unnamed, commodities giants.\n\nSaid Ayati over a call: \u201cWe will also soon be able to augment reported data with machine-sourced data from the myriad of satellites, sensors, and open source repositories out there watching to see where commodities have come from\u2026 were they transferred from a different ship on the sea, for instance?\u201d\n\nThe example that may catch Trump\u2019s ear, she says, is one where a commodity can be pre-checked for tariff before a transaction takes place.\n\n\u201cSome non-western governments we\u2019ve spoken to say that Western-country commodities traders sometimes claim that a commodity they\u2019ve bought will be going to, for example, Europe, but then it\u2019s sent to, for example, and Asian market,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they make a lot more money on that because they don\u2019t give the correct cut to the original commodity owners. With our system, the minute tariffs are due, even before money changes hands, the commodity can be checked for whether a tariff is due or not.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the claim would be music to Trump\u2019s ears, but it could certainly have the potential to speed up global trade hit by any tariff-induced slowdowns. The global commodities industry is already worth $20 trillion, so the stakes are clearly high.\n\nWatr\u2019s platform tracks commodities using blockchain-based tools \u2014 employing everything from decentralized IDs for institutions to digital fingerprints for raw materials.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Avalanche is a blockchain developed by Ava Labs which allows companies like Watr to create so-called \u201csovereign chains\u201d \u2014 tailored to specific industry needs, in this case, the world of commodities. It\u2019s already used by JP Morgan, Citibank, and FEMA.\n\nAdmittedly, this isn\u2019t the first time blockchain has been pitched as the fix for the commodities trade.\n\nIn the U.S., \u201cThe Seam,\u201d an agriculture-focused digital exchange, partnered with IBM in 2017 to explore blockchain-based cotton trading, targeting transparency and accountability in agricultural supply chains.\n\nThen, in 2018, a group of industry giants including ING, Shell, and ABN AMRO backed the komgo initiative, a blockchain-based platform aimed at streamlining trade finance for commodities. Its goal was to reduce fraud and delays by digitizing key documents like letters of credit and KYC records. Coincidentally, Ayati was also part of that initiative.\n\nHowever, outside of Watr, many of those earlier projects have fallen by the wayside.\n\nCommenting, independent web3 VC Keld van Schreven, founding partner of KR1, told TechCrunch that Watr\u2019s plans would have to be tested by the market: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen plenty of grand claims from web3 startups on supply chains, but if Watr can truly bring pre-trade tariff validation \u2018onchain\u2019 to scale \u2014 especially with backing from major players and a seasoned leadership team \u2014 this could mark a serious inflection point for blockchain adoption in global trade.\u201d\n\nHe added that the move to the Avalanche blockchain \u201calso signals they\u2019re thinking about scalability from the start. That said, as ever the proof will be in actual transaction volume and industry adoption beyond the initial pilot stage.\u201d"}
