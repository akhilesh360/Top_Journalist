Some invent robots to assist or replace manual labor, while others use machine learning to help businesses discover insights. Synergies Intelligent Systems falls into the second category.\n\nMichael Chang founded Synergies in 2016 in Boston to provide easy-to-use AI-powered analytics tools to medium-sized manufacturers. Having worked at Foxconn in Shenzhen in the late 2000s helping the Apple supplier improve yield rate, or reduce the percentage of defective products, using data analysis, Chang realized that not every factory has the financial prowess to spend tens of thousands of dollars on digitization.\n\nSynergies\u2019 vision and recent growth have won investor support. The company was mostly bootstrapping during its early years, but it recently accepted venture funding to accelerate hiring, market expansion, and product development. It secured $12 million from a Series A funding round led by NGP Capital, which was formerly called Nokia Growth Partners and is backed by Nokia, as its name implies. Private equity firm New Future Capital also participated.\n\nSynergies now operates a team of about 70 employees across Shanghai, Taipei, Guangzhou, Singapore and Boston.\n\nThe startup declined to disclose its valuation but said it\u2019s serving nearly 100 customers, 80% of which are in Greater China, including mid-sized factories with thousands of workers run by Foxconn and Fuyao, one of the world\u2019s largest auto glass producers. Chang told TechCrunch that Nokia and Synergies are working on some projects in the early stage, though the pair doesn\u2019t have a large-scale partnership yet.\n\nThe Finnish telecoms titan, to Chang\u2019s knowledge, has been promoting \u201cindustrial 5G\u201d worldwide, which is to bring next-generation connectivity to manufacturing. So it won\u2019t be surprising to see the two working more closely together in the future.\n\nSynergies\u2019 product could work well with 5G-powered factories that are constantly collecting and analyzing data in the cloud. It provides what\u2019s called an \u201caugmented analytics\u201d platform to help manufacturers optimize efficiency on three fronts \u2014 supply chain, yield, and production capacity.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Once the advice is put into practice and new data is reaped, Synergies\u2019 machine learning systems can analyze and keep refining its algorithms to help factories improve performance.\n\n\u201cSuch machine learning isn\u2019t rocket science for AI experts, but for an average small- and medium-sized factory in China, the overhead for creating a comprehensive \u2018data middle platform\u2019 is too high because it requires the coordination between the IT department, project managers, and AI experts,\u201d suggested Chang, an MIT graduate with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science.\n\n\u201cMost small and medium factories only keep a small team of IT staff, not to mention a team of dedicated AI scientists.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompared to advanced manufacturers in the West,\u201d Chang continued. \u201cChinese factories, even the ones that are massive now, have only been around for four or five decades. They are a lot more price-sensitive, operate at lower margins, and want quicker returns on investment. So it\u2019s hard to ask them to spend $10 million upfront on building a data platform.\u201d\n\nUsing data analytics and AI to refine business decisions also addresses the problem of high turnover in the manufacturing industry, Chang explained. As population growth slows in China, factories are struggling to recruit and retain workers, meaning it\u2019s hard to preserve workplace knowledge as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a business that sees the kind of crazy growth as, say, crypto companies,\u201d Chang maintained. \u201cBut I believe it\u2019s a meaningful business because we are creating real changes on the ground.\u201d"}
