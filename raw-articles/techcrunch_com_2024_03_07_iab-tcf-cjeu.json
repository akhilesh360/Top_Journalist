Today the surveillance data complex suffered another body blow: The bloc\u2019s top court flicked away arguments made by the ad industry body responsible for the tool \u2014 confirming the strings of data it generates in response to users\u2019 privacy choices are personal data, within the meaning of the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as they contain a personal identifier.\n\nThe Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) also held that the ad industry association responsible for devising the consent management tool, IAB Europe, is what\u2019s known as a \u201cjoint controller\u201d, with its advertiser members \u2014 meaning it can\u2019t eschew responsibility for ensuring the data processing complies with the GDPR. (Though the court did not find the IAB to be a controller for data processing operations that occur after the consent preferences of users are recorded \u2014 but it left the door open to that possibility should evidence of influence over follow-on data operations be found.)\n\nThe CJEU ruling follows a referral of questions from a court in Belgian where the IAB Europe challenged the February 2022 decision by the local data protection authority which found its \u201cTransparency and Consent Framework\u201d (TCF) breached the GDPR.\n\nThe Belgian DPA\u2019s decision was \u2014 and still is \u2014 a big deal for web users in Europe where consent spam has proliferated since the GDPR came into force in May 2018 \u2014 littering websites with never-ending pop-ups soliciting consent for \u201csharing\u201d user data with long lists of ad \u201cpartners\u201d.\n\nThe problem is these spammy pop-ups never looked GDPR compliant. A simple \u2018yes or no\u2019 to ad tracking is as much friction web users should get. But the adtech industry, well aware most people vote in favor of privacy when given a chance, opted to do everything possible to avoid offering people an easy way to deny tracking. Hence tracking opt-outs tend to be far less prominent, often buried in submenus of pop-ups (if they\u2019re even offered at all) \u2014 vs eye-catching \u2018accept\u2019 buttons easily within users\u2019 reach that make it super-simple to dismiss an annoying pop-up, but with a high, hidden cost to privacy.\n\nOther tactics the adtech industry has deployed since GDPR came into application include pre-checking sharing options and requiring web users to manually click through and uncheck multiple boxes \u2014 making it really tedious and time-consuming to try to reclaim your privacy.\n\nThere\u2019s even worse, too: Independent research has shown evidence of some adtech vendors plugged into the IAB\u2019s TCF continuing to track and profile Internet users even when they explicitly said don\u2019t want tracking-based ads.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Its legal challenge to the Belgian decision finding the TCF breaches the GDPR remains ongoing \u2014 but now the CJEU\u2019s ruling will be handed back to the court to factor in to that proceeding.\n\nThe ad association had sought to overturn the Belgian decision by arguing TCF strings are not personal data. It also challenged the authority\u2019s classification of it as a joint controller. On both counts the CJEU found otherwise. So it\u2019s not looking too rosy for the IAB\u2019s appeal.\n\nIn a press release today, the IAB acknowledged the court\u2019s ruling \u2014 saying it welcomes the \u201cwell-needed clarity over the concepts of personal data and (joint) controllership, which will allow a serene completion of the remaining legal proceedings\u201d. Which is one way of spinning totally losing the argument.\n\nIt also said it would be posting \u201ca more in-depth commentary of the ruling and of its consequences shortly\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Belgian Market Court will now resume its examination of IAB Europe\u2019s substantive arguments in line with the answers provided by the CJEU,\u201d it added. \u201cPending the conclusion of the proceedings before the Market Court which can take several months, the suspension of the execution of the APD [Belgian DPA\u2019s] decision (i.e. the implementation of IAB Europe\u2019s action plan following its validation) continues to apply.\u201d\n\nTranslation: The IAB expects to get a few more months\u2019 grace before the Belgium court rules on the fate of the TCF.\n\nIn an updated FAQ on the saga, the ad association seeks to deny the CJEU ruling is a blow to its chances of overturning the Belgian DPA\u2019s finding the TCF breaches the GDPR \u2014 claiming there is \u201cnothing in the CJEU ruling that could be viewed as even remotely questioning the legality of consent prompts or prohibiting their use by the digital ecosystem to comply with legal requirements under the EU\u2019s data protection framework\u201d.\n\nWhich, again, is some nice spin \u2014 given the CJEU\u2019s role is specifically to respond to the points of law raised. It\u2019s for the referring court to take the next steps, factoring in the top court\u2019s guidance on how to interpret key points of law pertaining to the case.\n\nAs a refresher, the Belgian authority\u2019s February 2022 decision on the long-running complaint against the IAB\u2019s TCF found breaches of Articles 5.1.a and 6 (lawfulness of processing; fairness and transparency); Articles 12, 13 and 14 (transparency); Articles 24, 25, 5.1.f and 32 (security of processing; integrity of personal data; data protection by design and default); Articles 30 (register of processing activities); Article 35 (data impact assessment); and Article 37 (appointment of a data protection officer).\n\nThe authority also issued a fine, of a quarter of a million Euros, on the IAB at that point \u2014 and gave it six months to bring the TCF into compliance. However action requiring reform of the framework was suspended pending a final court ruling on the IAB\u2019s appeal. Hence why pop-up consent spam persists to this day in the EU.\n\nThis zombie consent spam may \u2014 finally, finally! \u2014 be on its last legs with this decision, though. In a statement following the CJEU\u2019s ruling, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties\u2019 senior fellow and Enforce director, Johnny Ryan, one of the individuals who filed the GDPR complaints against the TCF, and prior to that, complaints against real-time bidding (such as this one against Google\u2019s adtech which still hasn\u2019t been decided by Ireland\u2019s DPA), predicted the end of this epic struggle is in sight.\n\n\u201cPeople across Europe have been plagued by fake \u2018consent\u2019 popups every day on almost every website and app since the GDPR was introduced almost six years ago. IAB Europe has sought to evade its responsibility for this charade. But the European Court of Justice has set it straight. This decision will not only end the biggest spam operation in history. It will deal a mortal wound to the online tracking-based advertising industry,\u201d Ryan wrote.\n\nStill, it\u2019s possible IAB\u2019s PR today is projecting \u201cserene\u201d legal proceedings ahead, despite the CJEU batting away its arguments, as it may have spied an alternative strategy for strong-arming consent-to-track from European web users \u2014 given the increasing creep of \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models, driven by Meta\u2019s adoption of the tactic last fall. (Here the consent choice is even more blatantly manipulative and abusive: Literally pay money for your privacy, by signing up for an ad-free subscription, or agree to tracking and get zero privacy.)\n\nThat said, the controversial \u2018consent or pay\u2019 model is already facing a swathe of privacy and consumer protection challenges. Plus the European Data Protection Board is due to weigh in with guidance soon. The European Commission is also looking into Meta\u2019s use of the tactic, as part of its oversight of very large online platforms under the Digital Services Act \u2014 which requires platforms to obtain consent for use of people\u2019s data for ads, as well as setting some conditions on how consent can be collected, in addition to the GDPR\u2019s informed, specific and freely given baseline.\n\nHow much longer the surveillance ads industry can scratch out operational runway in the EU \u2014 given shrinking legal avenues as privacy complaints and enforcements grind through the system; and with new compliance attacks opening up on multiple fronts \u2014 is unclear. It may be a matter of months. Or it may require the CJEU to weigh in on \u2018consent or pay\u2019 too (so, maybe max, a couple more years). But the only real choice left for the industry looks simple: Reform or die."}
