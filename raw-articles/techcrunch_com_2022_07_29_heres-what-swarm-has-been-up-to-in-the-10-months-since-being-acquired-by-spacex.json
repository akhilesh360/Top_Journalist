SpaceX is not known to be a super acquisitive company, so I was curious to hear about what it\u2019s been like for Spangelo and for Swarm. Mostly, it\u2019s been 10 months of rapid acceleration, she says.\n\nOne of Swarm\u2019s biggest blockers in terms of speed of deployment and growing its network was the ability to actually launch its satellites, which themselves are tiny \u2014 the company says they\u2019re \u201cthe smallest operational satellites in space,\u201d at little more than the size of your average sandwich. Spangelo said that unlocking launch availability has been one of the biggest benefits of operating under the SpaceX umbrella so far.\n\n\u201cAccess to basically free launch is pretty exciting,\u201d she told me in an interview. \u201cWe actually have launched probably three or four times since we last spoke [Editor\u2019s note: in June 2021 for our Found podcast], and we now have over 160 satellites in LEO [low-Earth orbit] \u2014 some of those are experimental.\u201d\n\nThose experimental payloads have helped the company improve its overall latency, so now it can guarantee latency at under one hour (meaning a Swarm satellite passes overhead any given point on Earth at least once an hour), which opens up broad new customer categories and applications for its low-bandwidth, hyperefficient connectivity services.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty important threshold, if you\u2019re doing any sort of monitoring, whether it\u2019s floods, water, forest fire detection, agriculture applications, logistics applications \u2014 that\u2019s like a pretty important threshold in that community,\u201d Spangelo explained. \u201cSo being low [latency], that has unlocked a bunch of exciting new use cases and customers.\u201d\n\nSwarm\u2019s tiny satellites have essentially been hitching a ride on SpaceX launches for other customers, where it\u2019s easy for the company \u201cto just pop them on\u201d in Spangelo\u2019s words. Satellite launch tends to be a game of ounces because of weight considerations, but the benefits of being the smallest operational satellites in space mean that you stand a better chance than most of fitting within existing mission payload parameters for SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rockets even with other cargo on board.\n\nWhile access to regular orbital delivery service is incredibly valuable to a technology like Swarm\u2019s, Spangelo says that it\u2019s also unlocked a host of other efficiencies that help the previously small startup leap ahead in terms of its maturation and infrastructure.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That\u2019s also helped us accelerate a lot of our production rate, [and] our hiring rate. We\u2019ve been scaling up and we\u2019ll probably do 10x the number of devices sold this year vs. what we did last year.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s a two-way street (it wouldn\u2019t make much sense as an acquisition otherwise) and Spangelo says SpaceX is already benefiting plenty, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also supporting SpaceX in a bunch of ways, from engineering and technology, and regulatory strategies, to lots of other programs that hopefully we get to talk about in the future,\u201d she said, reserving details on just what those programs might entail for now. I suggested that some kind of marriage between Starlink\u2019s consumer internet service and Swarm\u2019s connected device offerings might make sense, and she did agree that there are synergies they\u2019re exploring there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely having product discussions across the chasm that is Starlink broadband, to Swarm IoT and everything in between,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the roadmap really fills in a lot of the gaps between those things that you\u2019re hinting at. Certainly on the enterprise side, we\u2019ve started to engage with some of the same enterprise customers. You can imagine big agriculture companies, or oil and gas, or maritime companies have need for broadband, as well as for satellite IoT. So we\u2019ve definitely been able to benefit from those mutual relationships really both ways: Some Swarm customers are interested in Starlink, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nWith new use cases and new sales relationships, as well as plenty of demand on both sides, Spangelo says both Starlink and Swarm within SpaceX are still growing their teams despite the current macroeconomic conditions, especially when it comes to specific types of talent.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know that Starlink is actually kind of a networking company,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think of [SpaceX] as a hardware rocket company \u2014 a bunch of mechanical engineers. But the sophistication of the software, networking algorithms, back ends at the core networks and laser mesh networks, it\u2019s incredibly complicated. So we have, I think, over 200 software engineers on Starlink, and 500 or so at [SpaceX]. But we are definitely looking for incredible talent there.\u201d\n\nAs for what Spangelo is excited that Swarm has been able to do, and do better, working as a SpaceX company, she mentioned a number of new use cases that have come online since we last spoke, including wildfire detection. With a max of under one hour of latency, and often results that refresh in minutes, you can change considerably the approach to detection and mitigation of wildfires, which can spread for hours or even days without people knowing when monitored only through traditional methods. Swarm is working with a number of companies there, including Berlin-based Dryad Networks.\n\nAnother recent customer, Rainforest Connection, uses Swarm\u2019s IoT network to connect simple acoustic sensors deployed in the Brazilian rainforest.\n\n\u201cBasically, they have just an acoustic sensor, like you have on your phone, and it basically just hears a chainsaw, and then calls in the people that will stop the [deforestation],\u201d she said. \u201cThat one is just so cool to me \u2014 that such a simple sensor can have like such a big impact, because it\u2019s so hard to find these things.\u201d\n\nAs for what the future holds for Swarm, Spangelo says that they\u2019re actually pretty pleased with where the satellite hardware and design is currently, though they\u2019re looking to build more software products for enterprise customers. There are also \u201csome products that are more standalone that are actually more appropriate for tracking use cases, and some of the bigger enterprise use cases\u201d that don\u2019t require the sophisticated integration of their current modem design, she said, something more \u201con brand with\u201d Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cout of the box philosophy\u201d; something she said has already had influence on the product side.\n\nMeanwhile Swarm continues to operate out of its facility in Mountain View, just a short distance from a nearby SpaceX office, making collaboration relatively simple. The Falcon 9 launch pads are a little farther away, but you can\u2019t beat the price for the ride."}
