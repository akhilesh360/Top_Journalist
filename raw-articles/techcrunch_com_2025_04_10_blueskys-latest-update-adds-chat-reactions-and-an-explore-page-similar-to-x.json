Nope, it\u2019s not an edit button! Instead, the open social network is adding support for chat reactions in its direct messages feature and is revamping its search page as \u201cExplore,\u201d directing users to trends, suggested accounts, Starter Packs, and more.\n\nThe features both take inspiration from X, which has let users react to direct messages with an emoji since 2020. X expanded the feature a few years later, allowing users to choose any emoji beyond the default set.\n\nBluesky is now offering the same, as users can now click on the emoji button next to a person\u2019s message to add a reaction. In the initial pop-up, a handful of common emojis like the heart, thumbs up, eyes, sad face, and a laughing face are available. However, users can click on the three-dot menu to select any other emoji as their reaction, similar to what they can do in X.\n\nImage Credits:Bluesky\n\nNotably, the Bluesky search page is becoming more useful with the new release, as it now helps connect users to what\u2019s trending on the network. A feature like this may not have made as much sense when Bluesky was smaller, but with a now sizable user base of over 34 million users, it\u2019s easier to spot trends surfacing among the many discussions on the platform.\n\nFor instance, some of the trends today are linked to timely events, like Trump\u2019s tariffs and their impact, while others point to popular communities on Bluesky, like the readers on BookSky. The trends are also marked with labels like \u201cNew\u201d or \u201cHot\u201d or how long ago they began trending, like \u201c5h ago.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Bluesky\n\nIn addition, the new Explore page lets users enter their own interests to better personalize the content shown to them on Bluesky. It also offers suggestions of accounts to follow within different categories, like Art, Sports, Music, Comics, Politics, Science, News, Animals, Books, Video Games, and others.\n\nBelow this, the app suggests interesting Starter Packs \u2014 or, curated lists of users that newcomers can follow with a click \u2014 as well as suggestions of other popular custom feeds, like NFL+, which connects users to those talking about American football on Bluesky.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
