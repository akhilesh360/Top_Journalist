For example, last year, Virginia passed the Colorado Data Protection Act, which requires businesses to obtain consent before processing sensitive information, disclose when the information will be sold and allow customers to opt out. California, Colorado and the European Union have similar frameworks in place, while other states and nations are considering the same.\n\nSome marketers argue these protections have made it harder to suggest or predict which products customers might want. But Alex Elias says it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. He\u2019s the founder of Qloo, a platform that uses AI to help brands analyze customer preference data to provide recommendations, including recommendations for entertainment and physical goods.\n\n\u201cThe regulatory and platform environments around privacy have greatly restricted identity-driven means of understanding consumers. This has had seismic implications across sectors ranging from tech to consumer packaged goods, and led many companies to scramble to collect their own first-party data, which comes at significant risk,\u201d Elias told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cAt the same time, consumer tastes are becoming more fragmented and granular in their profiles, with the proliferation of media and music consumption making it more difficult to reach consumers.\u201d\n\nElias co-founded Qloo with Jay Alger, Qloo\u2019s chief operating officer, to solve these dual problems, Elias tells me. \u201cQloo can illuminate audiences\u2019 preferences at scale, the data can improve the efficiency of sales, power a lift in conversion and therefore increase bottom line,\u201d he said. \u201cMost companies that have a vested interest in understanding consumer taste at a more granular level can benefit from Qloo.\u201d\n\nIn a show of faith from investors, Qloo today nabbed a fresh $15 million in funding as a part of a Series B round led by Eldridge and AXA Venture Partners. It brings the company\u2019s total raised to $30 million, which includes contributions from high-profile celebrities like actor Leonardo DiCaprio, Elton John and Starwood Hotels founder Barry Sternlicht.\n\nQloo claims that its API correlates over 575 million \u201cprimary entities\u201d \u2014 including movies, books, restaurants and songs \u2014 to give predictions of consumer taste for \u201cdozens\u201d of enterprise clients, such as PepsiCo and Elton John\u2019s music company Rocket Entertainment. The API also powers TasteDive, a social media app with a built-in entertainment recommendation engine for films, TV shows, music, video games and books that Qloo acquired in 2019.\n\nAccording to Elias, Qloo doesn\u2019t use any personally identifiable information, keeping all requests \u201cad hoc\u201d and declining to store the identities of clients\u2019 customers. Data is ostensibly anonymized and encrypted, and the platform\u2019s data handling is \u201cfully compliant\u201d with regulations, including GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, Elias says.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For instance, Qloo can create \u201ctaste affinities\u201d for entities (e.g. music artists) overlaid on a geographic region, revealing the tastes and trends of particular cities and even neighborhoods (like which musicians are popular in Downtown Brooklyn). The platform can also generate descriptions about the tastes of groupings of entities or comparisons of entities, like the differences in music tastes between a Nike sneaker customer and Vans customer.\n\nArmed with Qloo and its integrations with Snowflake, Tableau and other existing data platforms, customers can better solve problems like driving sales, reducing ad spend and choosing retail locations, Elias asserts.\n\n\u201c[Qloo\u2019s] AI is attuned to a wide range of parameters, so end clients can adjust the weighting of the algorithm dynamically, based on how \u2018novel\u2019 or \u2018expected\u2019 they would like the taste correlations to be for the end consumer,\u201d Elias continued. \u201cFor example, a streaming client in Asia was able to prioritize regionally-specific results over globally popular recommendations and tune the algorithm accordingly.\u201d\n\nElias concedes that countless companies have tried to crack personalizations and recommendations through AI, including Mastercard-owned Dynamic Yield and RichRelevance. But he sees the Qloo platform as complementary to competitors that operate more generalized recommendation engines like Amazon Personalize, Azure Recommendations API and Google Cloud\u2019s Recommendations AI, as it putatively brings \u201cturnkey knowledge\u201d that they sometimes lack.\n\n\u201cQloo is differentiated because of its deep dataset and existing knowledge base across domains including music, products, travel and more. This allows Qloo to help clients achieve significant personalization with minimal supplied context,\u201d Elias said. \u201cQloo is also an advantaged competitor to traditional, more costly insights tools like focus groups or bespoke surveys, as it can quickly and more efficiently provide ad hoc insights based on much larger panels, e.g. \u2018What movies will people on the Upper East Side who like Lululemon also like?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Series B proceeds will support the launch of Qloo\u2019s newest product, Elias says \u2014 a \u201clite\u201d version of the platform that offers subscriptions to a visual interface designed for less-technically-savvy users. Beyond this, the money will bolster product development, expanding Qloo\u2019s 30-person team by over 30% in the coming months, and building out the company\u2019s sales channels.\n\nElias demurred when asked about revenue. But he said that Qloo has so far managed to buck the economic trend, thanks in part to recovering demand across industries like travel and entertainment.\n\n\u201cTwo years into the pandemic, Qloo has seen increased demand for its services leading to all-time highs in revenue and API utilization,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFundamental tailwinds including a drive towards privacy, focus on revenue growth and wide adoption of AI have greatly outweighed the headwinds from the macro environment and broader tech valuations. Qloo has managed a very lean burn rate and is nearing profitability.\u201d"}
