During the event, the exec praised Spotify\u2019s entry into the audiobooks market and detailed its future growth plans in the space. He also touched on how AI technology could both threaten and hurt publishers in the days ahead.\n\nOf note, Murray said that audiobooks continue to outsell e-books in terms of total revenues and are helping to offset declines from lagging e-book sales. In terms of AI, the CEO declined to discuss specifics of licensing deals, like the one it signed with Microsoft for AI model training, citing NDAs, but stressed that it\u2019s early days for AI licensing, calling it a \u201cfascinating time\u201d in the industry.\n\nHe also specifically praised Spotify\u2019s entry into the audiobooks space, referencing the 15 hours of free listening that\u2019s included with a Spotify Premium subscription in supported markets.\n\n\u201cSpotify entered the market in a very smart way,\u201d Murray explained. \u201cThey had several 100 million listeners of music and podcasts \u2026 so it was a very small, adjacent shift for them to monetize the audiobook listener.\u201d He also pointed out that while Amazon-owned Audible had been able to monetize the core audiobook listener, Spotify\u2019s model taps into the potential around the more occasional audiobook listener.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to sign up with a full commitment to so many books per year,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could \u2026 do it with your 15 hours free. You could sample. And I think that entry strategy \u2014 I mean, we now know a year later \u2014 that entry strategy has been very successful for Spotify, and as a result, we get a little bit of an incremental growth in our business in total.\u201d\n\nSpotify\u2019s relationship with HarperCollins, similar to Harper\u2019s deal with Audible, involves a wholesale distribution deal, which means that the publisher is paid on a consumption basis \u2014 a per-listen sort of model, Murray said. That sort of model is more direct than the streaming music model where a percentage of subscription revenue first goes into a pool and is then paid out to artists. The publisher can tell authors exactly what their royalties will be from audiobooks under this model.\n\nMurray additionally said there\u2019s room for growth with Spotify, as the company is working to adjust a \u201ctechnical problem\u201d with family plans, which currently limits audiobook streaming to the family plan\u2019s credit card holder. In time, Spotify will open up listening to all plan members, he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nReached for comment, Spotify said there\u2019s no technical issue, but expanding audiobooks across family plans is something it\u2019s testing in some markets now.\n\n\u201cEchoing Brian Murray\u2019s comments, we have been pleased with the growing interest in audiobooks and the resulting benefit to the publishing industry and authors,\u201d a Spotify spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cAlthough we have nothing to announce today, we\u2019re actively exploring ways to enhance the audiobook experience for Spotify plan members and look forward to sharing more in the future.\u201d\n\nSpotify has also been expanding audiobooks to more global markets, which opens it up for further growth.\n\nSwitching gears, Murray then spoke about the potential and concerns around how artificial intelligence will affect publishing.\n\nBeyond the obvious risks associated with IP-based businesses founded on copyright, the publisher is worried about generative AI, which could lead to an explosion of lower-quality content, competing for consumers\u2019 time and attention. Still, Murray said he thinks higher-quality content will ultimately win.\n\nInternally, AI could also help in areas of the business like marketing and selling, and there are already dozens of initiatives across departments at HarperCollins where they\u2019re trying to realize productivity improvements from AI, Murray said.\n\nAI could be useful for audiobooks, too, as it will allow the company to make audiobooks for smaller markets where it couldn\u2019t before justify the expensive. Book translations will also expand, opening up more revenue opportunities.\n\nFurther down the road, HarperCollins foresees how the technology could help turn books into film. \u201cYou can imagine taking a manuscript, pouring it in, and having a movie script or television script come out, and then using [OpenAI\u2019s] Sora to storyboard,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIn terms of \u2026 maybe speed to market or getting concepts \u2014 clear concepts \u2014 to the professionals in film and television \u2026 that\u2019s easier to do now.\u201d"}
