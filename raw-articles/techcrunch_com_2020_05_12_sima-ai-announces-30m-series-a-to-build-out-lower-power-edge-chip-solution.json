He decided to put that experience to work in a startup and launched SiMa.ai last year with the goal of building an ultra low-power software and chip solution for machine learning at the edge.\n\nToday he announced a $30 million Series A led by Dell Technologies Capital with help from Amplify Partners, Wing Venture Capital and +ND Capital. Today\u2019s investment brings the total raised to $40 million, according to the company.\n\nRangasayee says in his years as a chip executive he saw a gap in the machine learning market for embedded devices running at the edge and he decided to start the company to solve that issue.\n\n\u201cWhile the majority of the market was serviced by traditional computing, machine learning was beginning to make an impact and it was really amazing. I wanted to build a company that would bring machine learning at significant scale to help the problems with embedded markets,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nThe company is trying to focus on efficiency, which it says will make the solution more environmentally friendly by using less power. \u201cOur solution can scale high performance at the lowest power efficiency, and that translates to the highest frames per second per watt. We have built out an architecture and a software solution that is at a minimum 30x better than anybody else on the frames per second,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that achieving that efficiency required them to build a chip from scratch because there isn\u2019t a solution available off the shelf today that could achieve that.\n\nSo far the company has attracted 20 early design partners, who are testing what they\u2019ve built. He hopes to have the chip designed and the software solution in Beta in the Q4 timeframe this year, and is shooting for chip production by Q2 in 2021.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The timing could actually work in the company\u2019s favor because it can hunker down and build product while navigating through the current economic malaise.\n\nPerhaps by 2021 when the product is in production, the market and the economy will be in better shape and the company will be ready to deliver."}
