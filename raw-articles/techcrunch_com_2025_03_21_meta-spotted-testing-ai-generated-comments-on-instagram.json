From there, Meta AI will analyze the photo before generating three suggestions for comments.\n\nFor example, if the photo you want to leave a comment on is of someone smiling with a thumbs-up in their living room, Meta AI suggests that users comment \u201cCute living room setup,\u201d \u201cLove the cozy atmosphere,\u201d or \u201cGreat photo shoot location.\u201d If users don\u2019t like the first three AI-generated comments, they can refresh to get more suggestions.\n\nImage Credits:Jonah Manzano\n\n\u201cWe regularly test more features for you to use Meta AI across our apps,\u201d a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cOutside of DMs, you will find Meta AI there for you in areas like comments, feed, groups, and search to make your experiences more fun and useful.\u201d\n\nMeta did not provide any details of the test feature\u2019s availability, but the company noted it tested AI-generated comments on Facebook last year.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Many users yearn for the days when Instagram was more authentic and there wasn\u2019t as much pressure to perform, so the addition of AI comments could be deemed inauthentic and unnecessary.\n\nAs with any test feature, it\u2019s unknown when or if Meta plans to roll out the feature more widely.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Meta has experimented with leveraging AI in comments in different ways, as the company was spotted testing AI-generated comment summaries on Facebook last year."}
