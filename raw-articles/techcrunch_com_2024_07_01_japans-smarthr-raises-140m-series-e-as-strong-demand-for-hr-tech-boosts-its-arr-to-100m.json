Its annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached $100 million as of February 2024, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, which signifies a decent uptick from the $80 million in total revenue it reported in FY 2023.\n\nThat growth is in line with the robust demand for HR tech that we\u2019ve been seeing in other parts of the world. U.S.-based Rippling, which SmartHR says is its closest comparable company in terms of products and strategy, saw its ARR double to $350 million in 2023, per The Information. Gusto, which offers payroll management software and services, told TechCrunch its revenue had crossed $500 million by April 2023; and Deel, which manages payroll for companies across international lines, this March said that it had clocked ARR of more than $500 million.\n\nThere\u2019s also a mountain of venture capital in this market, estimated to be worth a whopping $81.84 billion by 2032, per Fortune Business Insights. Rippling, one of the biggest startups in the space, has raised about $1.4 billion, per a spokesperson at Rippling, and said it was valued at $13.5 billion following a $200 million funding round in April. Gusto has raised nearly $750 million, Crunchbase data says, and it is worth around $9.6 billion, per PitchBook. And Deel, worth $12 billion, has raised a total of $679 million, according to Crunchbase.\n\nAnd you have investors throwing cash at smaller startups attacking nearly every facet of traditional HR: Remofirst, which helps its customers hire globally without setting up local offices, recently raised $25 million; Palm takes a mobile-first approach to improving the HR tech experience in MENA, and last year got $5 million; Compa in January landed $10 million to build its platform that provides recruiters aggregated compensation data so they can be more competitive when hiring; and Legion last month raised $50 million to automate hourly staff management for companies.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
