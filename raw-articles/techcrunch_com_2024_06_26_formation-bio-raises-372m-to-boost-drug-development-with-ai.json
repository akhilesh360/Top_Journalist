The new tranche brings Formation\u2019s total raised to more than $600 million (according to PitchBook), which the company says is being put mainly toward partnership acquisition efforts and R&D.\n\nFormation declined to reveal its new valuation. But a spokesperson told TechCrunch that it\u2019s a \u201cmaterial step up\u201d from $1 billion, Formation\u2019s Series C valuation.\n\nThe company, which previously went by the brand TrialSpark, was co-founded by Benjamine Liu and Linhao Zhang in 2016. Liu has a background in computational biology, having conducted neuroscience research at Oxford and UPenn. Zhang is a software developer by trade and worked at Salesforce before joining Oscar Insurance as a product engineer.\n\nFormation builds tech-forward solutions for clinical trials and drug development. The company licenses drug IP from and co-develops drugs with biotech and pharma companies, and develops these drugs past clinical proof-of-concept.\n\nDrug development is a notoriously expensive and challenging endeavor. It takes 10 to 15 years on average to take a drug from initial discovery through regulatory approval, with the cost per drug reaching up to $5.5 billion. And an estimated 90% of drugs fail to reach the market.\n\nFormation claims it\u2019s able to run clinical trials more efficiently by streamlining processes such as study startup, participant recruitment and data management. For example, the company is currently deploying AI to generate patient recruitment materials and reports for \u201cadverse events.\u201d It\u2019s also fine-tuning AI models to provide drug development teams recommendations for R&D decisions and better predict drug toxicity, tolerability and efficacy.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

OpenAI said it would contribute access to AI capabilities and expertise, and Sanofi said it would bring proprietary data for developing AI models.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s involvement gives the appearance of conflict of interest, given that Altman was involved in Formation\u2019s Series C fundraising. OpenAI PR told TechCrunch the deal was led by OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap and OpenAI\u2019s board of directors but didn\u2019t indicate whether Altman, who\u2019s on the board, recused himself.\n\n\u201cAt Sanofi, we\u2019re all in on AI,\u201d Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson said in a press release. \u201cAnd we are proud to partner with and invest in Formation Bio, whose AI-driven drug development vision and capabilities will help lead our industry forward in the shared ambition to accelerate and improve how we bring more new medicines to patients.\u201d\n\nFormation has three drug candidates in its clinical pipeline, including treatments for chronic hand eczema, sensory neuropathy and knee osteoarthritis. The furthest along is the eczema treatment, which recently reached phase 3 \u2014 the last stage of testing before a drug is submitted to regulatory authorities.\n\nA number of startups are attempting to pioneer AI-powered tech for drug development, including EvolutionaryScale, which emerged from stealth this week with investments from Amazon and Nvidia. Market research firm Markets and Markets anticipates that the market for AI in drug discovery will be worth $4.9 billion by 2028. Major players in the space include Xaira (which launched with $1 billion), DeepMind spin-off Isomorphic, Insilico, Jeff Dean-backed Profluent, Enveda and Causaly."}
