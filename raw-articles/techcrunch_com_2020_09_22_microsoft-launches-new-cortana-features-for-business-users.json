Today, at its Ignite conference, Microsoft launched and announced a number of new Cortana services for business users.\n\nThese include the general availability of Cortana for the new Microsoft Teams displays the company is launching in partnership with a number of hardware vendors. You can think of these as dedicated smart displays for Teams that are somewhat akin to Google Assistant-enabled smart displays, for example \u2014 but with the sole focus on meetings. These days, it\u2019s hard to enable a device like this without support for a voice assistant, so there you go. It\u2019ll be available in September in English in the U.S. and will then roll out to Australia, Canada, the U.K. and India in the coming months.\n\nIn addition to these Teams devices, which Microsoft is not necessarily positioning for meeting rooms but as sidekicks to a regular laptop or desktop, Cortana will also soon come to Teams Rooms devices. Once we go back to offices and meeting rooms, after all, few people will want to touch a shared piece of hardware, so a touchless experience is a must.\n\nFor a while now, Microsoft has also been teasing more email-centric Cortana services. Play My Emails, a service that reads you your email out aloud and that\u2019s already available in the U.S. on iOS and Android, is coming to Australia, Canada, the U.K. and India in the coming months. But more importantly, later this month, Outlook for iOS users will be able to interact with their inbox by voice, initiate calls to email senders and play emails from specific senders.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This feature is now generally available and will get better meeting preparation, integration with Microsoft To Do and other new features in the coming months.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re using Cortana on Windows 10, this chat-based app now lets you compose emails, for example (at least if you speak English and are in the U.S.). And if you so desire, you can now use a wake word to launch it."}
