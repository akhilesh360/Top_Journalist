The new feed, which is launching as a tab within the Twitch iOS and Android apps, allows viewers to scroll through bite-sized bits of content to discover new streamers. The official launch follows Twitch\u2019s earlier tests of the feed that started in August 2023.\n\nWith this launch, Twitch now joins numerous other popular apps that have launched their own short-form video feeds following TikTok\u2019s rise in popularity, including Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Uber Eats and LinkedIn to name a few.\n\nThe discovery feed is finally here: the quickest way to find content you love on Twitch. Preview dozens of live streams & clips without pre-roll ads to find something to watch in minutes.

The \u201clive\u201d feed displays livestreams from both streamers users already follow and streamers that Twitch thinks they would like. The \u201cclips\u201d feed showcases top moments from streamers across Twitch, allowing viewers to discover content from streamers even when they\u2019re not live.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Since Twitch isn\u2019t a fully algorithmic platform like TikTok, Twitch streamers haven\u2019t had many ways to attract new viewers outside of promoting themselves on other platforms or teaming up with fellow streamers. With this new discovery feed, small and medium streamers have the potential to reach new audiences.\n\nTwitch says that all livestreams and clips are automatically eligible to appear in the feed if they meet the platform\u2019s content guidelines. While streamers can\u2019t directly upload content to the discovery feed, Twitch encourages them to create and feature clips of their content for a chance to be included in the feed."}
