Your IoT devices not being able to phone home. Rarely a problem when you\u2019re in the center of a well-populated urban center with oodles of cell towers, but think of that water temperature buoy floating around in the Atlantic, an autonomous drone flying above the rain forest or a glacier-creep measuring sonde high up in the mountains. The fact is that about 90% of the planet has no cell coverage at all, and Sateliot raised a \u20ac10 million ($11.4 million) round of funding to change that.\n\nThe company shared its pitch deck with us to take a deeper look, and so we will! Here\u2019s the good and the bad of this high-flying space deck.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here\u2019s how you can do that.\n\nSlides in this deck\n\nSateliot\u2019s deck consists of 18 slides and is almost as pitched; the company redacted some of the info that goes into depth about how its tech works.\n\nCover slide \u201c90% of the world has no cellular coverage\u201d \u2014 problem slide Team slide \u201cTo connect all NB-IOT devices from space under 5G standard\u201d \u2014 solution slide \u201cNear real-time connectivity\u201d \u2014 value proposition slide \u201cStandard protocol\u201d \u2014 product slide \u201cSateliot is the #1 satellite operator\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhy us?\u201d slide Market size slide Competition slide Business model slide \u201cMNOs engaged and technical integrations ongoing\u201d \u2014 traction slide \u201cEarly adopters program\u201d \u2014 go-to-market slide Interstitial slide Benefit slide Progress slide NGO program slide Slogan slide Closing slide\n\nThree things to love\n\nIt\u2019s always interesting to see companies that are trying to have an enormous impact on the space they operate in. Sateliot is making space for an incredible opportunity, essentially removing the need for infrastructure to make IoT solutions work from pretty much anywhere in the world with a clear view of the sky. It\u2019s a story that could be told in so many ways, and I was excited to see how the company launched into things.\n\nClear vision of the opportunity\n\n[Slide 2] Crisp and easy. Image Credits: Sateliot\n\nI love a deck that very clearly states the problem it is solving, especially if it\u2019s also able to highlight the advantage of solving that problem. Sateliot does that fantastically on its second slide \u2014 90% of the world has no cell coverage, and this company is promising to change that. There\u2019s not an investor in the world that won\u2019t be able to see the benefit and financial potential of that.\n\nAs a startup, if you can distill your problem, solution and opportunity this elegantly, you\u2019ve got yourself a great launchpad to start weaving your narrative for your pitch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This is hella compelling. Image Credits: Sateliot\n\nOne of the big questions an investor will be asking themselves is whether a particular company is well positioned to take charge of a market. In other words: Is there something about this team or company that gives them an unfair advantage over the competitors? This slide is labeled as \u201cvalue proposition,\u201d which is a little confusing. The slide doesn\u2019t describe a value prop but a competitive advantage. It describes the \u201cnumber of contributions to the 3GPP Standard,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t say what that means. Wikipedia has an answer that seems to indicate that this is very relevant, but I\u2019d love for the company to have contextualized it on this slide.\n\nThose caveats aside: If it turns out that contributions to the standard are directly relevant to the company\u2019s success and show that it\u2019s particularly well positioned to corner this market, this absolute design disaster and word soup of a slide might actually be a powerful storytelling device.\n\nScanning down the lists of companies that have made more and fewer contributions, there are a lot of big-name vendors. Seeing Sateliot in the top 25 or so \u2014 ahead of many other well-known companies \u2014 could suggest that there\u2019s a significant moat in place.\n\nI wish the company had connected the dots for me, but if this slide means what I suspect it means, it makes up for the distinctly subpar \u201cteam\u201d slide (which we\u2019ll discuss in a bit).\n\nAs a startup, what you can learn here is that if you have a moat, or some reason why nobody else can truly solve the problem at hand as well as you can, shout about it loudly \u2014 it makes you a far more tempting investment target.\n\nStrong social mission\n\n[Slide 14] Having a social mission component can help give investors the warm-and-fuzzies. Image Credits: Sateliot\n\nSome investors have a social responsibility mandate as part of their investment theses. That could go in your favor if your company is in alignment with doing good in addition to doing well. But what is also true is that all investors are human beings, and it can never harm to have a heart-forward aspect to your story. Sateliot explains that once its satellites are up and running, there is almost no marginal cost to being able to offer its services to certain customer groups. In other words: If you want to GPS-track rhinos, you can do so for almost no money.\n\nAs I said, that doesn\u2019t matter to all investors, but in this case, you\u2019re creating a win-win. Zero marginal cost means that there\u2019s no real downside to offering the company\u2019s services to causes that improve the planet and plenty of potential upsides. In addition to making the world a better place, there are PR opportunities, ESG advantages and secondary benefits to the company. Sateliot could very easily not have included this in its story, but it makes me happier that they did.\n\nThe lesson here is to think about whether you can tell your story in ways that appeal to audiences in multiple ways. Giving an investor the chance to brag about a company they invested in that\u2019s doing some good in the world can never harm, so if that\u2019s true for you (and it is a natural, logical part of the story), then why not throw it into the mix?\n\nIn the rest of this teardown, we\u2019ll take a look at three things Sateliot could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!\n\nThree things that could be improved\n\nThe deck is good, and it raised \u20ac10 million, so it was successful. But it also leaves a few things to be desired. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nIs this the right team? Who knows?\n\n[Slide 3] That\u2019s \u2026 a team slide. Just not a very good one. Image Credits: Sateliot\n\nOne of the most important things about a startup is whether the team is the right team to solve this particular problem. Sateliot knows that or it would not have put its team slide front and center. Unfortunately, as a slide, this isn\u2019t very good. Photos and job titles make a framework for telling the story, but they don\u2019t tell the story itself. This slide, in other words, cannot stand alone. It doesn\u2019t even have last names, so I can\u2019t quickly and easily look these folks up on LinkedIn to get a better impression of who they are.\n\nYes, three exits is impressive. Being industry veterans is helpful. Having experience with working together in the past further de-risks the team. But I would have preferred to learn more about how good these exits were, how being industry veterans is a benefit in this particular company and what the track record of this team is. In a way, this slide is just the dramatis personae of the startup \u2014 it doesn\u2019t start to explain what the character development is. It\u2019s like looking at the IMDb listing of a movie. Sure, you may recognize one or two of the actors, and it may even convince you to watch the film if you\u2019re a fan. With all respect to the Sateliot founders, they aren\u2019t Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr. or Samuel L. Jackson \u2014 as potential investors, we need a little bit more context and a synopsis of the movie we are about to watch, as it were.\n\nIt\u2019s important to help investors connect the dots; show your team, for sure, but also explain why this team is unbeatable in this market, with this product, at this time.\n\nTo Sateliot\u2019s credit, I expect that they probably tell that part of the story when they pitch the deck, so this criticism is only of the slide itself, not necessarily of the founders or whether they are the right people for the job.\n\nWait, what\u2019s a model?\n\n[Slide 12] Erm, that\u2019s not a business model. Image Credits: Sateliot\n\nSateliot\u2019s slide deck has four slides marked \u201cvalue proposition,\u201d none of which describe a value proposition. It also has three slides marked \u201cbusiness model,\u201d but none of them actually describe a business model. That\u2019s a little embarrassing but serves as a good reminder to check in with yourself to see if the slides are actually answering the question you are trying to explicate.\n\nA business model is some combination of, \u201cWhere will our customers come from and how do we attract them?\u201d along with \u201cHow will we make money?\u201d and \u201cHow will we retain our customers in the long run?\u201d Slide 12, at best, is an early customer acquisition mechanism (and ironically gets pretty close to showing the value proposition for the company), but even then it doesn\u2019t say anything about how much it will cost to acquire customers.\n\nThe company gets a little hand-wavey about numbers in general, and I\u2019m not a fan of that: If you have customers or revenue, show them on a graph. If you don\u2019t, tell us how you\u2019re going to get them and how you\u2019re going to turn those customers into revenue. I suspect that for Sateliot, the business model will be something like \u201cattract customers through partnerships and charge them a certain amount per device or per megabyte.\u201d If that\u2019s true, then just say that, and if the business model is something a little more exotic, definitely explore that: Investors will want to know.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t give our product away for free\u201d\n\n[Slide 15] I think this is an accidental joke. But I\u2019m not sure. Image Credits: Sateliot\n\nThis slide made me laugh out loud. What I saw here was a company that is saying that they are getting closer to agreements with nonprofits \u2014 which means they haven\u2019t gotten to an agreement yet. Then it says that it is planning to give these products away for free for climate and social projects.\n\nI get how they got to this slide, but what I read as a potential investor is that they\u2019re trying to give the product away for free and haven\u2019t been successful so far. That\u2019s not something worth bragging about, and I\u2019m a little befuddled about what part of the story this slide is meant to tell.\n\nI always recommend that my pitch coaching clients read their own slides with as much cynicism as they can muster. It isn\u2019t about what you are trying to say, it\u2019s about what you are actually saying and whether the slide in question is in service of your ultimate goal: Will you be more or less likely to raise money after someone sees this slide? If the answer is \u201cmore,\u201d keep it. If the answer is \u201cless\u201d or \u201cthe same,\u201d perhaps it\u2019s best to get rid of the slide altogether or update it until it does some more of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe full pitch deck\n\nIf you want your own pitch deck teardown featured on TC+, here\u2019s more information.
