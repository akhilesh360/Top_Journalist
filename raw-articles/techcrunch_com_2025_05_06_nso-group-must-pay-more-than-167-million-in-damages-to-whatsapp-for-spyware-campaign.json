Today, the jury\u2019s decision to force NSO, a notorious foreign spyware merchant, to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve.\u201d\n\nNSO Group\u2019s spokesperson Gil Lainer left the door open for an appeal.\n\n\u201cWe will carefully examine the verdict\u2019s details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal,\u201d Lainer said in a statement.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The Meta-owned company accused NSO Group of accessing WhatsApp servers and exploiting an audio-calling vulnerability in the chat app to target around 1,400 people, including dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about NSO Group, or other spyware companies?

Tools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused, and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk.\u201d\n\nLast December, WhatsApp won. Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who presided over the case, ruled that NSO Group was liable for breaching federal and California hacking laws in its 2019 spyware campaign against the 1,400 WhatsApp users. The judge ruled that NSO Group was also liable for breaching WhatsApp\u2019s terms of service, which prohibit the use of the app for malicious purposes.\n\nCathcart celebrated the December ruling saying in an X post that it was \u201ca huge win for privacy,\u201d and that \u201csurveillance companies should be on notice that illegal spying will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nAt that point, the case moved on to a jury trial to determine what damages the spyware company owed WhatsApp, which has now concluded.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, where he has studied the spyware industry for more than a decade, celebrated the ruling.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredible moment for those of us who have been around since the beginning of research on mercenary spyware,\u201d Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. \u201cNSO makes many millions of dollars helping dictators hack people. After years of every trick and delay tactic it only took the jury a day\u2019s deliberation to see right through to the heart of the matter: NSO\u2019s business is based on hacking American companies\u2026so that dictators can hack dissidents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company emerges from this trial severely damaged. Aside from the huge punitive damages, the bigger impact of this case has also been a huge blow to NSO\u2019s efforts to hide their business activities,\u201d said Scott-Railton.\n\nThis story has been updated to include comments from WhatsApp and John Scott-Railton."}
