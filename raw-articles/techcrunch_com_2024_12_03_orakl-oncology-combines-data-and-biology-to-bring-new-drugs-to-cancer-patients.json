According to French entrepreneur Fanny Jaulin (on the right in the picture above), the problem lies with clinical trial design.\n\n\u201cJust because a drug isn\u2019t successful in clinical trials doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a good drug,\u201d she told TechCrunch. Hence the need for better ways to trial new molecules, especially for cancers in which innovation has failed to make a dent in recent decades.\n\nHer startup, Orakl Oncology, applies AI to this problem, but Jaulin is prompt to admit that her team is far from being the only one doing so. In fact, she thinks AI is becoming table stakes in drug discovery. But that\u2019s not where Orakl\u2019s differentiation lies, she said.\n\nFounded in 2023 as a spinoff from the Gustave Roussy Institute of Oncology, Orakl operates at the intersection of data and biology, which makes it different from companies that only do one or the other, and more akin to Tempus, the AI health tech that went public earlier this year.\n\nBoth sides are complementary; the data side helps deal with the fact that each tumor is unique, while the biology side is the best way to take the complexity of cancer into account, Jaulin said.\n\nThe result is hybrid, with avatars that combine the background of real patients with tissue. Currently, this means working on organoids, which are miniaturized, simplified in vitro versions of an organ that can be used for trials.\n\nAs for the data layer, it includes some 40 variables per patient, which makes up for the fact that its corpus is still smaller compared to its larger competitors, and with an initial focus on colorectal and pancreatic cancers.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This makes the former better suited for drug developers, while the latter can also serve AI- and data-led biotech companies, Jaulin said.\n\nThis commercialization plan will be funded by the seed round it has just raised and that comes in addition to the \u20ac3 million pre-seed round the startup secured in 2023. Led by European VC fund Singular, it also follows some nondilutive funding from Bpifrance, including the Grand Prix i-Lab, bringing Orakl\u2019s total capital raised to date to nearly \u20ac15 million.\n\nWhile most of the proceeds will go toward building a commercial team to close contracts, it is not what made Jaulin become an entrepreneur. With cancer becoming a chronic disease and a therapeutic arsenal \u201cundersized for what\u2019s at stake,\u201d her long-term goal is to unblock the precision medicine discovery process to \u201cget as many drugs as possible to patients.\u201d"}
