In 2024 alone, we\u2019ve seen the likes of Healx raise $47 million to tackle rare diseases; Sam Altman-backed Formation Bio raise $372 million; and Xaira emerge from stealth with a whopping $1 billion in funding.\n\nGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Director John Jumper, meanwhile, shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on Alphafold, an AI system that accurately predicts protein structures \u2014 vital for drug discovery.\n\nAqemia, for its part, says it\u2019s using physics and statistical mechanics algorithms to train a generative AI system, which then helps design potential drug candidates for \u201ccritical diseases.\u201d The initial focus is on oncology (cancer) and immuno-oncology (using the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer).\n\nThe company says this approach to training AI negates the need for experimental data, which is costly and time-consuming, and instead uses algorithms to essentially generate synthetic data to predict the properties of potential drug molecules and how they might interact with the target.\n\nLondon\u2019s calling\n\nIt\u2019s clear that AI-enabled drug discovery is a hot space right now, and Aqemia itself has already been making headway in industry. Last December, the startup signed a multi-year agreement with French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, a deal that could be worth up to $140 million depending on the outcome of certain R&D milestones.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That includes a new office in London that\u2019s set to open in early 2025 \u2014 a move designed to give Aqemia \u201caccess to the UK\u2019s rich talent pool,\u201d according to a press release. Having a global VC firm like Cathay Innovation on board could also open the door to new markets.\n\n\u201cLess than a year after our last round, this successful fundraising and the opening of our new London office mark significant strides toward our ambition to accelerate the discovery of new medicines on a global scale,\u201d Levesque said in a statement. \u201cPartnering with Cathay Innovation brings international expertise, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, reinforcing our vision and mission.\u201d\n\nAside from lead backer Cathay Innovation, Aqemia\u2019s latest round saw participation from existing investors Wendel, Bpifrance Large Venture, Eurazeo, and Elaia."}
