Now, Altera wants to use the new capital to hire more scientists, engineers and team members to help with product development and growth.\n\nIf the first wave of AI for end users was about AI bots; and more recently, AI \u201ccopilots\u201d use generative AI to help understand and respond to increasingly sophisticated queries, then AI agents are emerging as the next stage of development. The focus is on how AI can be used to create increasingly more human-like, nuanced entities that can respond to and interact with actual humans.\n\nOne early use case for these agents has been gaming \u2014 specifically to use in games that support modifications (mods) like Minecraft. Voyager is one recent project, built on the Minedojo framework, that creates and develops Minecraft AI agents, and this, too, is where Altera is getting its start.\n\nThe company\u2019s first product is an AI agent that can play Minecraft with you, \u201cjust like a friend\u201d (the waitlist to try that out is here), but this seems to be just chapter one for the company. \u201cWe are building multi-agent worlds, opening up exciting opportunities in entertainment, market research, and more,\u201d the company promises on its site. And after that? Robot dreams, it seems.\n\n\u201cCreating the human qualities required to turn co-pilots into co-workers and exploring a world where digital humans are given a physical form factor,\u201d Altera explains.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Compared to the famous Voyager method, our Agents are 10-20X cheaper, more reliable, while remaining completely autonomous and Minecraft-agnostic.

In December 2023, Yang and Altera\u2019s other co-founders \u2014 Andrew Ahn, Nico Christie and Shuying Luo \u2014 stepped away from their applied research lab at MIT to focus on a new goal: developing AI agents (or \u201cAI buddies,\u201d as Yang calls them) with \u201csocial-emotional intelligence\u201d that can interact with players and make their own decisions in-game.\n\n\u201cIt has been my life goal as a neuroscientist to go all the way and build a digital human being \u2014 redefining what we thought AI was capable of,\u201d Yang told TechCrunch. That is not to say that Yang is coming from a misanthropic point of view. \u201cOur solidly pro-human framework means that we are building agents that will enhance humanity, not replace it,\u201d he insists.\n\nWhat is notable about Yang and Altera\u2019s focus is its consumer focus. This stands in contrast with a big swing that we have seen in AI toward building models that can be used either to speed up or sometimes replace humans in enterprise environments. (Even with OpenAI, ChatGPT has certainly been a viral hit globally, but at its heart the startup has been trying to build a business around usage of its APIs.)\n\n\u201cWe see more potential in building agents within the gaming industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis approach allows us to iterate faster, collect data more effectively, and deliver a product where there are eager users and where emergent behavior is a feature, not a bug.\u201d\n\n(And yes, in keeping with its consumer focus, you should not be surprised that, for now, the company is not talking about monetization at all.)\n\nAltera founders.

Unlike NPCs (non-player characters), they have the freedom to make their own decisions, which could either make the game more entertaining or frustrating, depending on your playing style.\n\nIn a video demo, Yang plays around with multiple scenarios, including one where he tries to convince the AI agent to attack other people. The bot is hesitant at first, typing in the chat, \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble, can we just find a peaceful solution? Fighting won\u2019t solve anything.\u201d Yang taunts it, commanding others to attack the \u201cweak\u201d bot. It eventually defends itself and kills Yang\u2019s Minecraft character. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure they regret crossing me,\u201d the AI agent wrote.\n\nWhile the ending may be a little sinister, the gameplay feels no different from a regular session with friends, trolling and competing against each other.\n\nAltera is currently testing the model with 750 Minecraft players and plans to officially launch later in the summer. It\u2019ll be available via Altera\u2019s desktop app, which is free to download but will also come with paid features.\n\nAltera demo.

Altera\u2019s AI agents \u201cexecute an action as code, meaning they can play any game without material customization,\u201d Yang explained. For instance, it could work with Stardew Valley, he said. Altera will also integrate the technology with game engine SDKs for \u201cbroader developer use.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the recent investments by First Spark and Patron, Altera has gained support from a long list of high-profile investors, demonstrating confidence in the company\u2019s potential. Altera boasts investors such as Alumni Ventures, a16z SPEEDRUN, Benchmark partner Mitch Lasky, Duolingo Chief Business Officer Bob Meese, Vamos Ventures, Valorant co-founder Stephen Lim and more.\n\n\u201cThere exists a massive opportunity to create AI companions that engage in all areas of our lives. However, today\u2019s AI lacks critical traits like empathy, embodiment, and personal goals, which prevent it from forming real, lasting connections with people,\u201d Aaron Sisto, partner at First Spark Ventures, said in a statement. \u201cRobert and the team at Altera are leveraging deep expertise in computational neuroscience and LLMs to build radically new types of AI agents that are fun, unique, and persistent across platforms. We are thrilled to be a part of their journey.\u201d"}
