Xonai, an early-stage startup, is taking a different approach to cloud cost reduction.\n\nIt\u2019s looking at ways to make your data software run more efficiently, and thereby reduce the cost of your overall workload, starting with Apache Spark. It plans to support other packages over time. Today, the company announced a $3.5 million seed investment.\n\n\u201cWe are helping organizations that need to scale data- and AI-driven products to reduce cost, and accelerate time to value,\u201d company co-founder and CTO Leandro Vaz told TechCrunch.\n\nThe company has chosen to focus on these data and AI products because by their nature, they require scaling of cloud resources in proportion to the business growth in order to maintain the quality of service. While Vaz couldn\u2019t share customer names, or the number of companies using the product at this point, he talked in general terms about the types of organizations that could benefit from using Xonai, such as adtech, financial services, retail, gaming or just about any data-heavy business.\n\n\u201cThey need to scale because they keep growing the amount of data they have to process as the business grows. Essentially what happens when engineers implement these things is that they have to scale the infrastructure horizontally and this almost always means that they use more machines,\u201d he said. And this essentially scales the cloud costs in proportion to the number of machines that they are using in the cloud.\n\nThis is where Xonai comes with a solution designed to bring down those data infrastructure costs. \u201cWe are doing something to really make these very demanding applications for AI and data run faster and use fewer resources,\u201d he says.\n\nThe beauty of the approach is it\u2019s fully automated, so you don\u2019t have to monitor the level of resources. The software takes care of that for you automatically via hardware acceleration that makes these workloads run faster with fewer machines. \u201cWe are leveraging novel developments in compilers and building a layer that allows you to essentially write these steps into a common language. Then we can optimize all these steps together, and by doing that these applications run compute much faster,\u201d he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

He says anywhere from 2-5x.\n\nThe company currently has around a dozen employees with a few open roles coming soon. At this early stage, they have gender and geographic diversity and he says as he hires, he is going to continue to make an effort to bring people from different backgrounds into the company.\n\nThe seed investment was led by Kadmos Capital with participation from Adara Ventures, Deep Science Ventures, Nauta Capital, Notion Capital and various industry angels."}
