That will put it in competition with Lyft and May Mobility, which recently announced a similar partnership to launch autonomous ride-hail in Atlanta this year.\n\nAs with Uber\u2019s other AV partnerships, customers in Arlington will have the option to choose a May Mobility vehicle \u2014 one of the startup\u2019s hybrid Toyota Sienna Autono-MaaS vehicles fitted out with its self-driving tech \u2014 when they book a ride.\n\nThe first deployment in Arlington will involve human safety operators behind the wheel before transitioning to driverless. Following initial launch, Uber and May Mobility intend to expand to other U.S. markets in 2026 and \u201cdeploy thousands of AVs\u201d over \u201cthe next few years,\u201d according to May Mobility.\n\nMay Mobility operates on-demand autonomous microtransit services \u2014 essentially self-driving shuttles \u2014 primarily in small-scale areas across the U.S., typically on campuses and in other low-speed, predefined zones. The startup has piloted its technology in Arlington, Texas, as well as in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Grand Rapids, Minnesota; Peachtree Corners, Georgia; Miami, Florida; and Sun City, Arizona.\n\n"}
