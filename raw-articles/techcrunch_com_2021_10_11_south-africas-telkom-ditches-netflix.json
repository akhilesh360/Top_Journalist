It\u2019s not clear whether it has plans to build a different route to consumers and existing subscribers in South Africa now that its relationship with Telkom has ended.\n\nLast month, the company announced a free plan, available on Android mobile phones, in Kenya to attract new subscribers \u2014 who have access to \u201cabout one-quarter of its TV shows and movies\u201d.\n\nNetflix, in a bid to win and retain subscribers across Africa, now features content produced in various markets across the continent, including South Africa\u2019s \u201cQueen Sono\u201d, Kenya\u2019s \u201cSincerely Daisy\u201d and Nigeria\u2019s \u201cTwo weeks in Lagos\u201d.\n\nThe video streaming service is looking to tap 303 million people, about 28% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa, connected to mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy report. The number of people connected to mobile internet is expected to grow to about 40% of this population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Netflix.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

MultiChoice Group Limited, the continent\u2019s largest pay-TV provider, now offers Netflix and Amazon.Inc as part of its paid video services in South Africa after signing deals with the two firms mid last year. The move aims to retain MultiChoice\u2019s subscriber numbers, creating more of a moat around its own budget streaming service, Showmax, introduced in 2015."}
