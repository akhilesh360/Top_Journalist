That\u2019s a drop from the $8.6 billion post-money valuation Nuro secured after its $600 million Series D in 2021, but most startup valuations have come down from the highs seen during the era of easy money.\n\nUsually, a down round can be cause for concern, as it might reflect diminished investor confidence among slower-than-expected progress. That said, it\u2019s a tough funding environment out there. It\u2019s also possible that in Nuro\u2019s case, the company may need less capital as it pursues a recent business pivot that now focuses on licensing its self-driving technology to automotive OEMs, commercial delivery fleets, and ride-hail companies.\n\n\u201cOur last round was at the end of 2021, at the peak of the market. We feel very good about this valuation and the conviction it shows in our new go-to-market strategy,\u201d Dave Ferguson, co-founder and president of Nuro, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been operating efficiently for the past several years and are now on a capital-efficient path forward, building a strong and durable business alongside our partners.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch reported on Nuro\u2019s shift in strategy in the fall of last year.\n\nNuro\u2019s previous go-to-market plan revolved around building and operating cute on-road delivery robots that could carry only goods, not passengers, for partners like Domino\u2019s. But building vehicles is expensive work, and Nuro was burning cash fast.\n\nAfter several rounds of layoffs and putting its manufacturing plans on hold, Nuro decided to focus instead on beefing out its self-driving technology, which it had been continuously testing in California and Texas. In May 2023, Nuro\u2019s founders said in a blog post that advancements in AI would accelerate the company\u2019s autonomy progress, which would extend its runway from 1.5 years to 3.5 years.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

A Nuro spokesperson told TechCrunch the round will support commercial expansion plans through 2027.\n\nDespite the down round, it\u2019s a good sign for Nuro that its backers are mostly existing institutional investors \u2014 like T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Tiger Global Management, Greylock Partners, and XN LP \u2014 as well as strategic partners.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to see strong investor enthusiasm for our Series E,\u201d said Jiajun Zhu, co-founder and CEO of Nuro, in a statement. \u201cOur technology, years of experience with driver-out Level 4 deployments, and focus on licensing uniquely position us to help automakers, mobility platforms, and commercial fleets accelerate their autonomy roadmaps.\u201d\n\nWhile Nuro still isn\u2019t sharing which strategic investors have joined the round, the company has existing relationships with Uber and Toyota through its investor Woven Capital, the venture arm of Toyota.\n\nNuro\u2019s new business model puts it in direct competition with startups like U.K.-based Wayve, which also hopes to see its technology powering everything from personal autonomous vehicles to robotaxi fleets.\n\nThis article has been updated with more information about Nuro\u2019s runway and a statement from Nuro\u2019s president and co-founder Dave Ferguson.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed Nuro\u2019s projected runway.
