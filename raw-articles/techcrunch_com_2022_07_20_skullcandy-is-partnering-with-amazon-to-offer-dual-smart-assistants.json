Skullcandy unveiled its voice assistant last year with limited functionality to control play/pause songs, control volume, skip tracks and accept/reject calls. Now, on select headphone models, you\u2019ll be able to use Skullcandy\u2019s own assistant to control playback and Alexa to issue other smart commands such as finding a song, getting information about the weather or setting a reminder.\n\nIn May, Sonos unveiled its own voice assistant for a range of speakers to control and even play songs on select services like Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer and Pandora. But you can also add other assistants like Amazon Alexa for other smart commands.

These are some of the features that will make it easier for customers to use multiple assistants on a device without worrying about remembering a voice assistant\u2019s specific features and limitations.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company is clubbing Alexa Smart Screen SDK and the AVS Device SDK under a single SDK called Alexa Voice Service(AVS) SDK 3.0 to enable multimodal experiences across smart devices."}
