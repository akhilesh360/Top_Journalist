In May, the company began letting advertisers create full new ad images with AI and insert AI-generated alternate versions of ad headlines. And in June, Meta began testing AI-powered customer support for businesses using WhatsApp, which automatically answers customer queries related to frequently asked questions.\n\nMeta claims that more than a million advertisers are using its AI ad tools and that 15 million ads were created with the tools last month.\n\nAI ads boost click-through rates, Meta says. But there\u2019s evidence to suggest customers may not like ads with chatbots. One survey commissioned earlier this year by customer experience platform Callvu found that the majority of people would rather wait at least a minute to speak with a live customer agent than chat instantly with an AI."}
