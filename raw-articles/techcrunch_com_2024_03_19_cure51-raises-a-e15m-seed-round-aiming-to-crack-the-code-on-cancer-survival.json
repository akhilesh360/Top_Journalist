Other investors in the round included Hitachi Ventures GmbH, Life Extension Ventures, Xavier Niel and Olivier Pomel, the CEO and co-founder of Datadog.\n\nCure51 will now use the money to build a \u201ccohort\u201d of data to work out why certain cancer patients survive for a long time, even with highly aggressive forms of the disease.\n\nCure51 was founded in March 2022 by Nicolas Wolikow and Simon Istolainen. Wolikow formerly founded healthtech startup Qare, and Istolainen has previously been an investor and consultant in healthcare.\n\nWolikow told me: \u201cThere are plenty of companies licensing oncology databases, but their databases don\u2019t include survivors. They don\u2019t present such a granularity of multi-omics data (single cell and spatial), and they lack ethnic diversity.\u201d\n\nHe also claims companies like Flat Iron (Roche), Market Scan (IBM) and Iqvia offer \u201csimple databases with clinical data and sparse genomic data.\u201d But molecular databases \u201cat multi-omics levels are required for drug discovery,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, Simon Turner, a partner at Sofinnova Partners, commented: \u201cLooking at \u2018mechanisms of exceptional survival\u2019 is not a new concept, but Cure51 has taken this to a whole new level in terms of the scale of the endeavor, plus leveraging the latest in analytical techniques.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
