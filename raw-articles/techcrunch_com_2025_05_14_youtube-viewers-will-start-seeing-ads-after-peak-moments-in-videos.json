This is part of YouTube\u2019s new ad format called \u201cPeak Points.\u201d\n\nThe company revealed the new ad format during its Upfront presentation on Wednesday in New York.\n\nPeak Points leverages Google\u2019s Gemini AI to analyze YouTube videos and identify moments it believes have the highest viewer engagement or are most emotionally impactful, and then suggests placing the ad right after it.\n\nImage Credits:YouTube\n\nPoint Peaks aims to benefit advertisers by using a tactic that aims to grab users\u2019 attention right when they\u2019re most invested in the content. This approach appears to be similar to a strategy called emotion-based targeting, where advertisers place ads that align with the emotions evoked by the video. It\u2019s believed that when viewers experience heightened emotional states, it leads to better recall of the ads.\n\nHowever, viewers may find these interruptions frustrating, especially when they\u2019re deeply engaged in the emotional arc of a video and want the ad to be over quickly to resume watching.\n\nIn related news, YouTube announced another ad format that may be more appealing to users. The platform debuted a shoppable product feed where users can browse and purchase items during an ad."}
