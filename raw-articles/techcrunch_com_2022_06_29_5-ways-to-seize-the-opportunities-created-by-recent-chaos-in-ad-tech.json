New platforms, mediums, M&A activity, privacy rules and ever-changing consumer behavior can all wreak havoc on the digital landscape. However, companies that are prepared to seek out these moments of change will be well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities produced by dynamic shifts.\n\nMost recently, media technology stocks have become highly volatile for a host of reasons. While many marketers are reallocating budget away from these platforms, and prioritizing more stable channels like Google Adwords and Amazon Marketing, there are always new opportunities born of shifts in the market.\n\nFor example, the dip in Meta\u2019s customer acquisition performance has enabled ad sales on TikTok to be expected to triple to more than $11 billion in 2022, which exceeds the combined sales of Snapchat and Twitter.\n\nTechCrunch+ is having an Independence Day sale!

This constant change is an opportunity to create value, but only if you take calculated risks, stay agile and be prepared to act.\n\nAs the major platforms are forced to innovate, advertisers who are willing to \u201cbe like water\u201d and flow with change are going to come out ahead.\n\nThe short and long-term impact of stock price volatility\n\nStock price volatility applies pressure on publicly traded social media ad platforms, which motivates them to build new features, lower their rates to attract spend and experiment with new business models. For example, Twitter is contemplating a subscription model.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This provides a huge opportunity for early movers that are able to \u201chack the system\u201d before the masses.\n\nThat\u2019s why TikTok is currently exploding with advertising revenue. But how can founders predict which platform or business model will be the next best investment? The answer, of course, is that they can\u2019t. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to diversify advertising dollars and always be testing.\n\nRegardless of the specific disruptions happening in the space at any given moment, advertisers should always be proactively testing new platforms and be adaptive in their approach to finding the next golden vein of growth.\n\nRely on proven channels while testing new platforms\n\nThere will always be some choppy waters when new business models are tested and emerging. To counteract the risk associated with testing new platforms or implementing unproven strategies, advertisers should still allocate the majority of their budgets towards proven channels, even if it means accepting slightly diminishing returns.\n\nThey should also diversify aggressively in as many productive channels as possible, since few of us can predict when the next wave of change might shake up the system.\n\nInvest in first-party data insights\n\nFirst-party data is the only true source of information that advertisers can rely on. When applied correctly, first-party data is still the best means of accessing targeting in a post-iOS 14 world.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to get, once you have first-party data, you can accurately rely on the insights that come from it. Accessing first-party data gives you a huge advantage for approaching long-term customer acquisition strategies and digital growth.\n\nThis Deloitte article explains the value, and necessity, of establishing your ecosystem of first-party data. The research concludes that \u201cfirst-party data offers extensive opportunities to strengthen client relationships and can serve as an identifier for activation across platform[s].\u201d\n\nWhile a company\u2019s first-party data is reliable, it is also limited in scope and can only provide insight into a company\u2019s own customers. Through advances in data analytics, it is now possible for advertisers to access aggregated pools of first-party data across a network of digital companies, allowing them to recreate some of the insights lost with iOS privacy changes while still remaining compliant with privacy regulations.\n\nDiversify your ad platforms\n\nSince the iOS 14 privacy change, Meta has struggled to remain precise and accurate in tracking and targeting, since a large percentage of users continue to opt out of being tracked. (Current data suggests that somewhere between 54% to 63% of users opt out, but that number was as high as 80% in October 2021). As a result, the company is shifting tactics.\n\nBy lowering ad rates and pushing for a broader advertising approach to monetize more impressions, Meta can increase its chances of hitting its mark using probabilistic modeling. For Meta, this has cushioned the blow of the iOS 14 changes. In the first quarter of 2022, the company\u2019s ad impressions rose 15% in the quarter, while price per ad fell 8%.\n\nThis shift has left advertisers, however, feeling frustrated and helpless. It seems like just when they had become reliant on a trusted source of efficient customer acquisition, it was quickly taken away from them by the larger ecosystem, or even removed by Meta so that it can control how advertisers use its platform.\n\nNow, many companies are moving their Facebook ad budget to other platforms like Google AdWords, since they are not impacted by App Tracking Transparency (ATT), as the source of data acquisition comes from self-prompted search.\n\nThey are also moving more of their ad budget to Amazon, which has benefited significantly from the lack of trust and confidence in advertising on Meta. Amazon\u2019s closed loop garden \u2014 where it can see, manage, analyze and keep all of its consumer data within the system for themselves \u2014 allows them to produce better performance.\n\nProtect your brand against unchecked content\n\nTwitter\u2019s potential focus on free speech over content monitoring may result in an influx of new users seeking access to such unchecked content. It\u2019s still unclear whether other content platforms will follow suit.\n\nEach content platform has its own marketplace dynamics, and they all need to balance their supply of content with the demand for that content. Regardless of where unchecked content resides, the internet is filled with it. Platforms must ask themselves if unchecked content hurts the quality of the existing user experience, and if so, what they will do about it.\n\nWhatever the outcome, founders must protect their brand at all costs. The old advice still rings true: Treat every piece of content, post or email like it could end up on the front page of the New York Times tomorrow. Be diligent about managing online reviews. Maintain your website, blog and other IP so that you keep control over the content, and in turn, over your search engine results.\n\nBuild trust with your consumers, so that if unchecked content does appear in the complex, muddy waters of the internet, your consumer will ultimately have a reliable source of information about your brand and what you stand for.\n\nAlthough it may seem like the world of digital advertising is in constant crisis, these crises can become opportunities to make inroads with consumers and maximize advertising spend, especially for leaders who can move quickly and remain flexible.\n\nBut to turn disruption into progress, founders and CMOs must be willing to ride the wave of continuous innovation and change. They must be diligent in their evaluation of new business models, create an agile, multifaceted strategy that can keep up with the ebbs and flows of consumer behavior and always be on the lookout for the next opportunity to maximize the moment."}
