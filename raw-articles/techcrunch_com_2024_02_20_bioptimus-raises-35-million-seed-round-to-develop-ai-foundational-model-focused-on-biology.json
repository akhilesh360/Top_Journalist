But what makes Bioptimus interesting is that it plans to apply everything we\u2019ve collectively learned about AI models over the past few years with a narrow, exclusive focus on biology.\n\nThe reason it makes sense to create a startup focused exclusively on biology is that access to training data isn\u2019t as simple in this field. While OpenAI is slowly moving away from web crawling in favor of licensing deals with content publishers, Bioptimus is facing different data challenges as it will have to deal with sensitive clinical data that isn\u2019t publicly available at all.\n\nAnd just like other AI startups, Bioptimus is going to be a capital-intensive startup as it will train its models on expensive GPUs and hire talented researchers. That\u2019s why the startup is raising a $35 million seed round led by Sofinnova Partners. Bpifrance\u2019s Large Venture fund, Frst, Cathay Innovation, Headline, Hummingbird, NJF Capital, Owkin, Top Harvest Capital and Xavier Niel also participated in this funding round.\n\nBioptimus isn\u2019t coming out of nowhere. At the helm of the company, Jean-Philippe Vert will act as co-founder and executive chairman in a non-operational role. At his day job, he is the chief R&D officer at Owkin, the French biotech unicorn that tries to discover new drugs and improve diagnostics through AI.\n\nRodolphe Jenatton, the CTO of Bioptimus, has more experience in artificial intelligence, as he was a senior research scientist at Google. Several co-founders are also former researchers at Google DeepMind.\n\nAs part of Owkin\u2019s work for top biopharmas, Owkin has amassed multimodal patient data through partnerships with leading academic hospitals around the world. Bioptimus will leverage this unique dataset to train its foundational model.\n\nA moonshot project from Owkin\n\nBioptimus could even be considered as a sort of spin-off company from Owkin \u2014 or a so-called moonshot project. But why didn\u2019t Owkin decide to work on a foundational model in house? Creating new AI models is such a daunting task that creating a separate entity made more sense.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cBuilding biology [foundational models] is not a part of Owkin\u2019s roadmap, but Owkin supports and is keen to partner with a company like Bioptimus. Training very large-scale [foundational models] requires important resources in terms of data volume, computing power and breadth of data modalities that are easier to unlock as a specific entity,\u201d Vert told TechCrunch. \u201cAs a \u2018pure player\u2019 in foundational models, Bioptimus is better set up to do this.\u201d\n\nThe startup has also signed a partnership with Amazon Web Services. It sounds like the company\u2019s model will be trained in Amazon\u2019s data centers. Now that Bioptimus is well funded, it\u2019s time to work on the AI model and see what the biotech research community can do with it.\n\n\u201cEventually, the AI we build will improve disease diagnosis, precision medicine, and will help create new biomolecules for medical or environmental use,\u201d Vert said."}
