And these two systems also need to be tightly integrated, in part because you need to run calibration and error correction algorithms on the classical machines to keep the quantum machines running. But every additional compute cycle then also helps to run additional functions and evaluate the data from the quantum computer.\n\n\u201cQuantum computers do have a very natural place \u2014 and that is to power supercomputers,\u201d said Quantum Machines co-founder and CEO Itamar Sivan. \u201cThe most natural place for them, I think, is in supercomputing infrastructure and cloud infrastructure. On the one hand, these will be the first places to integrate quantum computing at a greater scale. We want to power these supercomputers with quantum, but we also want to power the quantum with the supercomputers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what this collaboration is all about. You can\u2019t run a quantum computer without massive classical compute resources and for a supercomputer, quantum essentially becomes another co-processor for handling specific tasks, similar to how GPUs are often used to accelerate machine learning tasks, for example.\n\n\u201cIf you have a million cubits or hundreds of thousands of cubits and each has a dozen parameters that need to be independently optimized \u2014 the leaders in the community are turning their attention towards AI methods, which shine on an NVIDIA platform,\u201d explained Tim Costa, Nvidia\u2019s director of high performance computing and quantum. \u201cThere\u2019s this huge GPU compute requirement for standing up a computer which will deliver on the promise of quantum. And to do that, of course, we have to get tightly coupled to quantum, so we need to work with the leader in the field in terms of interfacing with quantum and controlling quantum, which is Quantum Machine.\u201d"}
