Judge Kaplan praised Wang\u2019s cooperation with federal authorities. Wang testified against former FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried at his trial last fall.\n\nWang pleaded guilty to four felony counts of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nFormer FTX CEO Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year, a sentence he filed to appeal in September. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX-affiliated Alameda Research, was sentenced to two years in prison in September.\n\nFTX and Alameda both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following a run on FTX\u2019s assets by investors and revelations of fraudulent activity at the company."}
