The Japanese automaker said the system will set a \u201cnew standard for autonomous driving with advanced collision avoidance capability.\u201d\n\nNissan said the system being developed for mass production by 2027 will be a Level 2 system operating under driver supervision. Nissan didn\u2019t disclose which models the system would be available in. Level 2, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, means the system can automate multiple driving tasks such as steering and braking but still requires a driver to maintain control at all times.\n\nWayve, which launched in 2017, has garnered attention and investors for its automated driving system, which is self-learning versus rules-based, similar to Tesla\u2019s approach. Wayve has developed its end-to-end data-driven learning approach for \u201ceyes on\u201d assisted driving and an \u201ceyes off\u201d fully automated driving system.\n\nUnlike Tesla, Wayve plans to sell its \u201cEmbodied AI\u201d to automakers and other tech companies.\n\nWayve\u2019s self-learning approach is seen as particularly appealing to automakers because it\u2019s not reliant on specific sensors or HD maps. This means Wayve\u2019s system can work with existing sensors like cameras and radar. The automated driving software captures data from those sensors, which directly informs the driving decisions of the system.\n\nAnd while the startup\u2019s development fleet uses Nvidia\u2019s Orin system-on-chip, co-founder and CEO Alex Kendall has said the software can run on whatever GPU its OEM partners already have in their vehicles.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
