Along with the raise comes the name change, with the goal of encapsulating the business\u2019 focus on employee recruiting and retention.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, its founders, sisters Deborah Gladney and Angela Muhwezi-Hall, said the rebrand was a year and a half in the making as they realized the changing relationship between employees and employers.\n\n\u201cFinding the right talent is just half the battle,\u201d Gladney said. \u201cWhere companies are really being hit the hardest is losing people faster than they\u2019re coming in the door.\u201d\n\nThey realized that their hard work to help companies find the right talent was fruitless if those businesses weren\u2019t doing anything to keep those workers.\n\n\u201cWe started leaning into what was happening to people post-hire and have started to focus on career development and talent retention tools,\u201d Gladney continued. \u201cSo our new name is WorkTorch. We want to be a guiding light to a better career, a better workforce.\u201d\n\nLaunched last April, the company says it has a roster of more than 40,000 service industry applicants actively looking for a job, with at least 1,000 interviews a month scheduled via the platform. As part of its rebrand, users will now have access to a career development portal where they can track professional growth, as well as connect with others who have similar interests.\n\nAt the same time, employers will now be able to access new retention tools to look at national and regional data trends, as well as receive feedback from their employees on their current working experiences.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

TechCrunch previously reported that VCs remain bullish on HR platforms despite \u201cThe Great Resignation.\u201d In the first two months of 2022, investors poured over $1.4 billion into the sector. This follows the more than $12.3 billion HR tech startups raised last year.\n\nGladney said it took about six months for WorkTorch\u2019s seed round to close because the founders felt pressure from investors amid the economic downturn.\n\n\u201cEvery check felt like a fight to get,\u201d Gladney said. The high of this fundraise was that most of their existing investors returned. Based in Kansas, the returning capital helped make the duo two of the few, if any, Black women to raise more than $1 million in the Midwest. \u201cAs two Black women in Kansas, we\u2019re super proud of that.\u201d\n\nThen there were lows, naturally, where they felt as if investors were stringing them along \u2014 even more than the last time they raised, when they picked up more than $1 million in funding. \u201cI felt like people were talking to us to check a box or make it feel like they\u2019re doing their part,\u201d Gladney said.\n\nMuhwezi-Hall said people would give soft commitments, perform extensive due diligence, and then back out, saying they actually never wanted to get into HR.\n\n\u201cIt was very odd,\u201d Muhwezi-Hall said. \u201cA lot of these individuals have social media presences that are focused on diversity and inclusion. We were excited to meet with them. But when push came to shove, it was like any other \u2014 probably even worse than the VCs that just wouldn\u2019t respond to our emails because they strung us along and wasted so much of our time.\u201d\n\nThey overcame the bias, though, and nabbed top investors such as Bloomberg Beta, MATH Venture Partners, Ruthless for Good Fund and Graham & Walker. The fresh capital will help WorkTorch expand into several new cities, including Chicago, Denver, Dallas and Atlanta. The Hackett Group found earlier this year that spending on HR Tech would probably increase by the year\u2019s end. This is Gladney and Muhwezi-Hall finding space in the current trend.\n\n\u201cEmployers need better tools and capabilities to meet the needs of their workforce, and service-industry professionals thrive when offered opportunities to develop and grow their careers,\u201d Josh Oeding, the founder of Tenzing Capital, told TechCrunch. \u201cWorkTorch has figured out how to deliver value to employers, and professionals and the market is responding.\u201d\n\nLeslie Feinzaig, the founder of Graham & Walker, added to that: \u201cI was deeply impressed by Deborah and Angela and had one of those magical first meetings where I immediately know I want to invest,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cIt was striking to me that this team deeply understands and respects the service workers, in a way that is rare in startup pitches. And this translates to metrics that are undeniable and unheard of for a startup at this stage.\u201d\n\nNext, Gladney and Muhwezi-Hall are hoping that WorkTorch becomes the go-to platform for anyone looking to see what\u2019s next for their careers. \u201cThis is what makes us different,\u201d Gladney said. \u201cWorkTorch is empowering people to pursue whatever they are passionate about. And then we come alongside them to help them get there.\u201d"}
