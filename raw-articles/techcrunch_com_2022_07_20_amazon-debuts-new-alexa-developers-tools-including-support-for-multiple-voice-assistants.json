They come a month after the company demoed forthcoming and experimental Alexa features at its annual re:Mars conference in Las Vegas, including the ability to synthesize short audio clips into longer speech.\n\nA highlight of today\u2019s event was the previewing of Amazon\u2019s Universal Device Commands (UDC) and Agent Transfers (AT), a pair of technologies intended to simplify the task of interacting with multiple voice assistants on the same device. On devices that support Alexa and another voice assistant, like Sonos\u2019 Sonos Voice Control, UDCs will let users say commands (e.g., \u201cTurn up the volume\u201d) using compatible wake words (e.g., \u201cHey, Sonos\u201d), even if the target assistant wasn\u2019t originally used to initiate the request. ATs, meanwhile, will allow voice assistants to transfer user requests (e.g., \u201cAsk UberEats to place an order\u201d) to other assistants when they don\u2019t have the ability to fulfill them.\n\nAmazon telegraphed its plans for UDC and AT two years ago in a whitepaper outlining design recommendations for members of the Voice Interoperability Initiative (VII), the company\u2019s program to ensure voice-enabled products ship with multiple voice assistants (inclusive of Alexa, unsurprisingly). VII members, who include Dolby and Facebook, agree to develop voice assistants that work \u201cseamlessly\u201d with others and build devices that ship with at least one assistant other than their own.\n\nAmazon said that it\u2019ll enable \u201ccloud side\u201d infrastructure for UDCs and ATs within the next year. In a peek at what\u2019s to come, Skullcandy and Native Voice, a tech consultancy, worked together to make Alexa and \u201cHey, Skullcandy\u201d commands available simultaneously on Skullcandy\u2019s Push Active and Grind Series headphones.\n\nThere\u2019s a limit to what UDC and AT can accomplish, what with Google and Apple so far declining to join VII. But even absent Siri or Google Assistant, Amazon makes the case that UDC and AT can deliver superior experiences by combining the capabilities of multiple assistants.\n\nSmart home tools\n\nIn a development that\u2019s tangentially related \u2014 at least in the sense that it has to do with smart devices \u2014 Amazon debuted the Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) SDK for Matter, a software package that extends the existing ACK to devices supporting the Matter Wi-Fi connectivity standard. Launched in 2019, ACK runs firmware that enables communication between a device and ACK-managed services like logging, usage metrics and over-the-air updates. Essentially, ACK (and, by extension, ACK for Matter) allows companies to use Amazon and Alexa cloud services while having freedom over the hardware that delivers those services.\n\nThe ACK SDK for Matter includes Amazon\u2019s \u201cfrustration-free setup\u201d (FFS) technology, which lets smart home devices automatically connect to a local network the minute they\u2019re powered on. On the subject of FFS, Amazon says that it plans to expand FFS from devices purchased through Amazon to devices purchased through third-party retailers, beginning with Matter devices.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

When this is available, customers will be able to select which of their devices and service providers to share network details with and set up those devices without having to enter an SSID or password. The API will support credentials for Matter devices with additional, expanded support to follow, Amazon says.\n\nAlexa Ambient Home Dev Kit, also launched today, offers APIs and services targeting smart home use cases, including device and group sync, safety and security and multi-admin setup for Matter. (Multi-admin allows Matter devices to be controlled by multiple smart home systems at the same time.) As Amazon explains in a blog post:\n\nFor example, if a customer leaves home and arms their security system, they want their robot vacuum to know they\u2019re gone so it can start cleaning. If they open their smart lights app and rename Guest Room to Office, they want that change to cascade to other systems \u2014 including Alexa. The \u2026 Ambient Home Dev Kit will enable these experiences along with many more.\n\nNew APIs in the Ambient Home Dev Kit extend Alexa Guard, Amazon\u2019s sound-identifying security feature, to third-party apps, allowing customers to be alerted through a custom app when things like audible smoke and carbon monoxide alarms are detected. Other APIs allow customers to expose (somewhat creepily) the state of their home to developers, like \u201cHome,\u201d \u201cVacation,\u201d \u201cDinner Time.\u201d Using signals from various devices throughout the house, Amazon says it can determine what\u2019s most likely happening and relay that information to third-party services, devices and apps \u2014 for example, adjusting the thermostat and locking doors during the \u201cSleep\u201d state.\n\nNew SDKs\n\nAmbient Dev Home Kit arrives alongside Alexa Voice Service (AVS) SDK 3.0, which combines two existing SDKs \u2014 the Alexa Smart Screen SDK and the AVS Device SDK \u2014 into a single toolkit for creating Alexa voice and multimodal skills across devices. One of the headliners is video calling between third-party Alexa devices, a feature that was previously limited to Amazon Echo devices. AVS SDK 3.0 also brings support for third-party smart home cameras, letting users see live camera feeds and chat with people at the camera through microphones and speakers.\n\nOn the multimedia side, AVS SDK 3.0 ships with the clumsily named \u201cAlexa Video Skills Kit (VSK) over AVS Downchannel,\u201d which can be used to create Alexa skills that control smart TVs. Apps and devices using the AVS SDK 3.0 can let Alexa users search for and play content, open apps, change the volume and more, Amazon says.\n\nA separate new SDK, the Alexa for Apps SDK, lets developers build Alexa functionality, including voice search and navigation, as well as custom interactions into mobile apps. Amazon previously offered Alexa-powered features for mobile through Alexa for Apps, an API, but the service was limited in what it could accomplish. The SDK greatly expands the ways Alexa can be integrated with mobile apps \u2014 perhaps signaling Amazon\u2019s ambitions.\n\n\u201cThe Alexa for Apps SDK is the first from Amazon to support the development of Alexa functionality within a new or existing app,\u201d Aaron Rubenson, VP of Alexa Voice Service and Alexa Skills at Amazon, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cFor example, a fitness app could use the Alexa for Apps SDK to design a workout with Alexa as the personal coach.\u201d\n\nPromotions\n\nSeveral of the tools announced today are germane to business dev, like Alexa Skill Deals, which gives developers the ability to set up a discount on in-skill purchases and paid skills that last for up to a year. As for Promoted Skills, they let developers run paid campaigns to promote their Alexa skills.\n\nAs Rubenson explained when asked about Promoted Skills: \u201c[They] are designed to be similar to how sellers and book authors advertise their products on Amazon\u2019s web and mobile properties. Later this year, developers will be able to set up skill promotions or campaigns designed for Echo Show home screens. In order to set up the campaigns, developers will upload their creative, select a campaign type, set a start and end date, and place a bid.\u201d\n\nPromoted Skills pricing has yet to be determined, Rubenson said.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexa Routines Kit enables skill creators to surface prebuilt routines to customers when they interact with their skill, while the Alexa Shopping Kit allows developers to provide product recommendations (and earn a 10% commission) that customers can add to their shopping carts and lists and then purchase. According to Amazon, Grupo Planeta, the Spanish-language book publisher, is using the Alexa Shopping Kit to deliver book recommendations through Diana, the company\u2019s mindfulness skill.\n\nAmazon\u2019s last bid to lure developers to the ecosystem began last December, roughly, when the company lowered its cut of Alexa skill developer revenue from 30% to 20% for developers who earn less than $1 million in revenue. As my colleague Sarah Perez noted at the time, relatively few developers have been able to capitalize on Alexa\u2019s sizable footprint in U.S. consumers\u2019 homes to create profitable businesses, despite Amazon\u2019s efforts.\n\nThat\u2019s not stopping the company from trying. Today, Amazon announced that developers earning less than $1 million in revenue will also receive 10% of their skill\u2019s earnings as an additional \u201cvalue back\u201d incentive, to be paid out in cash for this year. The increased revenue share goes into effect starting with the earnings for the month of July, Amazon clarified in a blog post."}
