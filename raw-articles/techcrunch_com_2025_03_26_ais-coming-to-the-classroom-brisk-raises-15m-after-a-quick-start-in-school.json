An AI edtech startup called Brisk has built a tool that could at least help teachers identify some of the telltale signs, and it\u2019s now announcing $15 million in new funding on the back of decent traction.\n\nAlongside a writing inspector, Brisk\u2019s platform offers around 40 tools for teachers and students to use by way of a Chrome extension. The platform uses generative AI, computer vision, and other AI features that Brisk says can help not only speed up work, but also do the work better. These include writing lesson plans, tests, and presentations; adjusting work for different abilities; grading work; and more.\n\n\u201cThe existing edtech stack as we know it, which is around 140 different tools that the average teacher in the U.S. uses in a given school year, is not ready for AI,\u201d Brisk\u2019s CEO and founder, Arman Jaffer, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build the AI-native edtech stack.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be used in part to build more tools, and in part to expand to more platforms. A Microsoft integration, aimed at the many schools that are Microsoft shops, is planned for autumn 2025.\n\nBusiness has so far been brisk for San Francisco-based Brisk. Since it raised a seed round of $5 million in September 2024, its user base has grown fivefold, and Jaffer said the company had \u201c40x\u2019d\u201d its revenue in 2024 (it\u2019s worth noting that the company was starting from zero). Brisk says more than 2,000 schools in 100 countries use its products today, and more than 90% of its business comes from inbound interest. One in five K-12 teachers in the U.S. have installed the Brisk extension as of February 2025, Jaffer added.\n\nBessemer Venture Partners is leading the Series A round, with previous backers Owl Ventures, South Park Commons, and Springbank Collective also participating (the $15 million is being disclosed for the first time today, with $6.9 million in the Series A).\n\nBrisk\u2019s funding and growth come at a time when technology and education are becoming increasingly intertwined.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

(The recent DoE changes in the U.S. have yet to play out, but it has raised concerns that they will spell yet more erosion of resources.)\n\nEnter tech, where adoption is easy, in a sense. There are literally hundreds of startups and much larger technology giants rolling out edtech apps. Some outfits cater directly to students and families, like the immense Khan Academy empire, while others direct themselves at schools and educators such as the suites developed by Google and Microsoft.\n\nAnd, just as enterprises have embraced consumerization in their IT departments \u2014 looking for apps that have the same usability as the most popular consumer apps \u2014 so have teachers looked for inroads to connect with students. Kahoot is a key example of how education has been \u201cgamified,\u201d the theory being this is one way of making learning more accessible.\n\nAI is yet another step in edtech\u2019s natural evolution. AI companies are building learning tools to that end, and their basic pitch is much like Brisk\u2019s: AI is coming whether you like it or not, and it will make everyone\u2019s lives better.\n\nBut as with other segments of the world of work and play, not all AI moves are received with open arms. OpenAI\u2019s teachers\u2019 guide to ChatGPT \u2014 released in November 2024, arguably well after the horse had bolted \u2014 was met with criticism over the bigger issues that it failed to address around accuracy and data protection.\n\nJaffer founded Brisk after spending time in edtech in a different capacity. He spent more than five years at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, where he conceived of and led a team building Notebooks, a Google Docs alternative aimed at improving collaboration between students and teachers. Ultimately, Notebooks did not take off, not least because, well, Google Docs does the job, but also because AI really changes the game for collaboration. That ethos was carried into Jaffer\u2019s next swing of the founder bat.\n\nIf using AI rings alarm bells, Brisk wants to muffle that with a measured approach: assistance, not replacement.\n\nThe company\u2019s student writing inspector does not conclude \u201cthis was written by ChatGPT.\u201d It starts with a video of a student\u2019s work process on-screen, which it then watches in fast-motion, flagging when that student has copy/pasted information or is otherwise doing other things that are uncharacteristic of how they work. This is then sent on to the teacher who can assess whether it could be an indication of copying from somewhere else, or if the work was indeed created by GenAI.\n\nThe most popular tool in the stack, \u201cTargeted Feedback,\u201d uses generative AI to read student essays (on Google Docs) and create comments that are tailored to age, a grading rubric, or other standards if they\u2019ve been uploaded or selected. Before anything is shared with students, teachers can review and edit the comments (in the best-case scenario, they are doing that rather than just shifting them along with no oversight).\n\nWhether the idea of AI taking on some of teachers\u2019 work, and maybe even doing it better, is loved or feared in the world of education, it seems that the trend line is too clear to be ignored, said Kent Bennett, the Bessemer partner who led this investment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re big believers at this AI moment in tracking sectors like education technology, which have a reputation for being tech phobic. This reputation often arises because the high-value workflow in these environments involves human language, and thus wasn\u2019t as addressable with legacy software \u2014 with LLMs all of that can change,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an email exchange.\n\n\u201c[But] one of the biggest surprises as we looked into AI powered ed-tech was that educators were not just tolerating AI, they are aggressively seeking it out,\u201d he said, adding that it is \u201cobvious\u201d that teachers cannot be cut out of the equation altogether.\n\nLooking forward, Brisk will be building more immersive tools beyond its extensions. Later this year, it will be switching on a new web platform so that \u201ceducators can work cohesively and natively within the Brisk environment.\u201d It will include new resources and activities, Jaffer said.\n\nBrisk also wants to offer more \u201cmultimodal\u201d integrations. These will include the ability for students to submit image-based work, in addition to text, for evaluations; and a \u201cpodcast\u201d feature to generate audio versions to describe documents and more."}
