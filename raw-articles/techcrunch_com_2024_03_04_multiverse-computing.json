The market for high-level quantum computer science \u2014 which applies quantum principles to manage complex computations in areas like finance and artificial intelligence \u2014 appears to be quickening its pace.\n\nIn the latest development, a startup out of San Sebastian, Spain, called Multiverse Computing has raised \u20ac25 million (or $27 million) in an equity funding round led by Columbus Venture Partners. The funding values the startup at \u20ac100 million ($108 million), and it will be used in two main areas. The startup plans to continue building out its existing business working with startups in verticals like manufacturing and finance, and it wants to forge new efforts to work more closely with AI companies building and operating large language models.\n\nIn both cases, the pitch is the same, said CEO Enrique Lizaso Olmos: \u201coptimization.\u201d\n\nIn other words, as computing becomes more advanced, computations can be more costly and in some cases too complex to execute consistently. Multiverse\u2019s pitch is that its software platform Singularity \u2014 designed to apply across a wide range of industries like finance, manufacturing, energy, cybersecurity and defense \u2014 can be used to run and optimize complicated modeling and predictive applications more efficiently.\n\nIn AI, the focus is more squarely on applying the platform to compress large language models, with a new product called CompactifAI honing in on the calculations that are constantly being made when building and querying LLMs, to cut out more noise and speed up the work (and thus reliability) when producing results.\n\nThe company claims that its services, accessed by clients via APIs, can compress LLMs \u201cwith quantum-inspired tensor networks\u201d by more than 80% with the software, while still producing accurate results. If true, that could have large implications for how companies buy and use processors, addressing one of the big bottlenecks in the industry to date.\n\nLizaso Olmos cuts a polymath figure, starting out his career more than 30 years ago by first qualifying as a medical doctor, then taking a second degree in mathematics, and then a third in computer engineering with a PhD in biostatistics, which somewhat tied these things together. He then picked up an MBA, he said. Over the course of all that, he picked up like-minded thinkers and friends, and some of them \u2014 namely Roman Orus and Samuel Mugel \u2014 were interested in the concept of quantum software and were already making names for themselves through academic work around the subject.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The year was 2017, and for the thought experiment, a few of them thought it \u201cwould be fun\u201d to write a scientific paper about what you could do with quantum in finance.\n\nThe paper ended up getting accepted for a conference taking place at the university in Toronto, so they went along to that. Arriving, Lizaso Olmos saw that the paper was getting shared around and discussed and suddenly it looked like people might use it as inspiration for enterprising ambitions. That was when Lizaso Olmos\u2019s MBA-radar kicked in and he pulled his two friends together for a serious IRL chat.\n\nAnd that is how they, along with Alfonso Rubio, started Multiverse Computing.\n\nThat initial exploration of quantum and financial technology that was the subject of that paper became the company\u2019s first commercial application, and where it picked up its first traction. Since then it has widened out into other sectors and counts Moody\u2019s Analytics, Bosch, BASF, Iberdrola, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and BBVA among its customers, and Lizaso Olmos says that together, industrial and energy clients, who like the greener aspects of more efficient computing, today actually account for more of the company\u2019s business than finance.\n\nAlongside Columbus, previous backer Quantonation Ventures also participated alongside new backers like the European Innovation Council Fund, Redstone QAI Quantum Fund, and Indi Partners.\n\n\u201cMultiverse\u2019s exceptional team will soon apply their unparalleled capability to deliver quantum and quantum-inspired software solutions also within the life sciences and biotechnology markets, where Columbus Venture Partners will help to identify unmet market needs and high-profile industrial partners,\u201d Javier Garc\u00eda, a partner at Columbus Venture Partners, said in a statement.\n\nWhile the pitch to verticals seems to have connected with customers, what remains to be seen is how its ambition to go one level higher, to target deep tech and AI companies themselves, might play out for Multiverse. Others competing in the same space include the Alphabet spinout Sandbox AQ, Quantum Motion, and Classiq."}
