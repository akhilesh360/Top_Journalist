Over the years Amazon has developed a number of strategies, from machine learning and monitoring tools to good old-fashioned phone calling to identify and reduce risks to their network.\n\nThe company on Monday revealed an internal umbrella platform for the first time that has been in place for several years, called Mithra, which it built to handle Amazon scale. The main piece of technology underlying the solution is a massive graph database with 3.5 billion nodes and 48 billion edges, according to C.J. Moses, Amazon\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO). (Mithra runs on internal systems inside Amazon as opposed to being a service that customers pay for directly.)\n\nMoses says in simple terms that Mithra is basically a big funnel. \u201cWe have to go from lots of data down to very small amounts of data. The further you get down that funnel, the more you\u2019re able to then have humans become engaged to be able to make the final decisions on what needs to be done,\u201d Moses told TechCrunch.\n\nIn some cases, where the software has a strong signal that a domain is bad, humans don\u2019t even need to be involved in the decision making; at Amazon\u2019s scale, taking humans out of the loop when it can is important. \u201cIf you get down to where you have strong assurance that a domain is bad, we\u2019re able to take that data and very quickly transition it straight into the systems that protect our environments,\u201d Moses said.\n\nThat could involve the web application firewall (WAF), Amazon GuardDuty, the company\u2019s threat detection system or even forwarding the domain in question to the AWS security service team for further review when required. Moses says when you combine Mithra with Sonaris, the company\u2019s network observation platform, it provides a \u201cpretty good defensive net around our AWS and Amazon environments.\u201d\n\nAmazon scale is unique.The company deals with a quarter of all internet traffic every day, according to Moses, and it \u201cobserves up to 200 trillion DNS requests in a single AWS Region alone. Mithra detects an average of 182,000 new malicious domains daily.\u201d\n\nThe company has been using a combination of AI, ML, algorithms, monitoring and other tooling, but as it grows and scales, it realized it needed to have a single platform dedicated to monitoring the system for malicious domains and snuffing them out whenever possible. That\u2019s where Mithra comes in.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Here\u2019s a preponderance of the data that\u2019s been assembled from Mithra, from Sonaris, from other threat sensors that we have, and then use that AI to coalesce it together into recommendations to the different systems that take the defensive measures,\u201d Moses said.\n\nGenerative AI has a role to play because it enables the threat analysts, who are doing the threat hunting, to interact with the data in plain language and get back answers to help understand the situation better. Previously they would have had to run scripts, but generative AI provides a faster way to see what\u2019s happening.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s not about shutting down domains, or how sophisticated the tech is, but just being able to pick up the phone and call a fellow CISO about what his team is seeing. \u201cSome of our biggest investment is in making sure we have a very viable CISO network so we can pick up the phone and call someone at 2 a.m. and not have it be a cold call, even if they\u2019re not customers of ours,\u201d he said.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated to clarify when Mithra was launched."}
