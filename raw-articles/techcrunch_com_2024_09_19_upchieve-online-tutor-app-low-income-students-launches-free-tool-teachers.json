They can invite students to sign up for tutoring, create classes, and monitor students\u2019 platform usage. Previously, students had to sign up for tutoring services themselves, but with this new product, teachers can now recommend students for 1:1 tutoring at no cost. In the coming weeks, they\u2019ll also be able to assign tutoring sessions to entire classes.\n\nUPchieve for Teachers is available to educators working in Title 1 middle schools and high schools. Title 1 is a federal aid program provided to K-12 schools with the highest number of low-income families within school districts. Approximately 43% of public schools qualify for Title I funding, with fewer than 50,000 schools benefiting from the program.\n\nThis new offering is expected to help UPchieve expand its user base by reaching students who may not be aware of free services like this or who may not be actively seeking additional assistance.\n\n\u201cThe product is going to be really valuable to teachers because it\u2019s going to help them accomplish some of the hardest parts of their job,\u201d founder Aly Murray told TechCrunch. \u201cStudents are coming into the class with different gaps in their foundational skills. Teachers have to try to support all of their students, but there\u2019s not enough time to support each student individually, so that\u2019s a natural place where a tutor can help. We\u2019re really excited about launching a product that\u2019s going to give teachers more control.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:UPchieve\n\nUPchieve was founded in 2016, shortly after Murray graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. As a former low-income student herself, she struggled to access academic support services throughout her schooling and wanted to make it easy for other students to be able to get help whenever they needed it, even when working on homework late at night.\n\n\u201cI was raised by a single mom, and as an immigrant to the United States, she often wasn\u2019t able to help me with schoolwork and with my college applications. And so that had a big impact on my life. It made things very difficult, and I found that I often needed help late at night when there was really nowhere I could turn to for support,\u201d Murray said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Its 24/7 online tutoring sessions are conducted in the in-app messenger or via voice chat on the web or mobile app. UPchieve covers over 30 subjects, including math, science, English, history, humanities, and more.\n\nTutors can volunteer by signing up on the website. Volunteers can even be students themselves; however, they must be in 9th grade or higher. UPchieve currently has around 2,400 tutors active on the platform.\n\n\u201cAll of the volunteers on UPchieve go through a background screening, training, and certification process to become a volunteer tutor. Before they\u2019re ever going to work with a student, they have to pass a quiz in every subject that they want to help students with,\u201d Murray explained.\n\nImage Credits:UPchieve\n\nSimilar to other edtech companies, the company utilizes OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o to assist tutors in providing AI-generated feedback and progress reports to students after the sessions are over. In the future, the company also plans to use AI to help tutors create practice problems and offer AI-generated summaries of student sessions through its Teachers product.\n\n\u201cWe have no plans to replace our human tutors with AI tutors anytime in the near future,\u201d Murray added.\n\nAs a nonprofit organization, UPchieve relies on charitable donations, grants, and paid partnerships with schools, districts, and corporations. Donors include Atlassian, AT&T, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Guggenheim Capital, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, the Skyline Foundation, and Verizon.\n\nUPchieve has partnered with over 50 schools, and each school or organization pays a $10,000 partnership fee per year or is sponsored by a donor or corporation who pays the fee on their behalf. The company also graduated from Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2021 batch.\n\nIn 2023, UPchieve raised over $4 million through philanthropy and earned revenue from paid partnerships. The company claims its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is currently $840,000, which comes solely from paid and sponsored partnerships."}
