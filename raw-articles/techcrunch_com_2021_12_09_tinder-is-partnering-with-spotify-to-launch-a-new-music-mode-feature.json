Users who link their Spotify accounts and add a chosen song, called an \u201cAnthem,\u201d to their Tinder profiles will be able to enter Music Mode. It\u2019s worth noting that Tinder and Spotify first partnered in 2016 to launch the Anthem feature, which allows users to add music to their dating profiles. This latest integration is a new way for users to discover their potential matches\u2019 favorite songs.\n\nMusic Mode will be rolling out to Tinder users globally, in all markets where Spotify is available, in the coming weeks. The new feature will be found on Tinder\u2019s interactive \u201cExplore\u201d page. Tinder notes that the new feature builds on the natural ties between music and human connections by allowing users to connect through their tastes in music.\n\n\u201cNow with Music Mode, our members can experience that feeling when you\u2019re at a party and you find out someone else loves the same songs you do,\u201d said Kyle Miller, the vice president of product innovation at Tinder, in a press release. \u201cSongs are deeply personal, and Music Mode is a place to spark something new through music.\u201d\n\nThe company says about 40% of Gen Z Tinder users have already added Anthems to their profiles and when they do, they see nearly a 10% increase in matches.\n\nThis latest launch comes as Tinder has been rolling out new features to allow users to engage with others in new ways. For example, the aforementioned new Explore section features events, as well as new ways to discover matches by interests. It also allows users to dive into quick conversations with others before a match is made. The company also recently launched a new \u201cPlus One\u201d feature. Through the feature, users are able to signal that they are either looking for a date to a wedding or are willing to be one.\n\nLast month, Tinder also brought back \u201cSwipe Night,\u201d its interactive in-app event that allows its users another way to break the ice besides just matching and chatting, this time featuring a \u201cwhodunit\u201d murder mystery. The Swipe Night feature is available in the Explore section. Also available in this section is \u201cHot Takes,\u201d which lets members chat in real time in a sort of speed dating, timed experience, and \u201cPassions,\u201d where users can meet others with similar interests, among other things."}
