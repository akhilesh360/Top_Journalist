It\u2019s acquiring Rapid, formerly known as RapidAPI, a startup that operates an API marketplace. Nokia will be integrating Rapid into a platform it\u2019s building to help 5G operators open their networks to more developers.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal are not being disclosed in the official announcement. Rapid was once valued at $1 billion and counted as many as 4 million users tapping into some 40,000 APIs, but it\u2019s seen a significant decline in its business in the last couple of years. The companies are not disclosing Rapid\u2019s active users as of today except to note that it is a number in the thousands, and that APIs are in the hundreds. As Nokia is publicly traded, more financial details may come through in a future filing. (Update: some have conjectured that the deal could be for as little as $100 million.)\n\nThe deal will include a public marketplace, enterprise services, and an enterprise-grade API hub designed for building, testing, and sharing APIs internally and externally; and Nokia is pitching it as a move to help carriers work more easily with developers.\n\n\u201cOperators need a bridge to connect to thousands of developers to drive enterprise and consumer value creation and monetize their networks,\u201d said Raghav Sahgal, president of Cloud and Network Services at Noka, in a statement.\n\nOn Rapid\u2019s side, the landscape for technology has shifted drastically over the last couple of years, and many later-stage startups have found it challenging to meet the lofty forecasts they had set while raising big funding rounds in more buoyant years. Rapid\u2019s $1 billion valuation was based on a funding round from 2022.\n\nRapid rose to prominence amid a boom of interest in APIs a decade ago, when APIs were first emerging as the webbing between businesses and developers building services around them. Rapid\u2019s pitch was that it provided a one-stop place to find and use APIs in what appeared to be a very fragmented market.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear that Rapid found a route to profitability in providing that service. Rapid\u2019s founder Iddo Gino (a wunderkind who started the company aged just 17 in 2015), stepped down as CEO in April 2023, replaced by Marc Friend, and in the weeks following, the startup saw at least two major rounds of layoffs that reduced headcount by 82% (cue headlines of the company\u2019s \u201cRapid descent\u201c).\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nRapid, based out of San Francisco, had raised nearly $273 million in venture funding from big-name investors that included Andreessen Horowitz, Microsoft, and SoftBank, among others.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people are actually at Rapid as of now, nor how many would be joining Nokia in the deal. Nokia\u2019s statement emphasizes product more than people, noting that it is acquiring \u201ctechnology assets, including the world\u2019s largest API hub used by thousands of active developers globally, and its highly skilled research and development unit.\u201d\n\nFor Nokia, the acquisition is an interesting and slightly ironic turn given the Finnish company\u2019s history as a pioneer in the world of mobile.\n\nBack in the 1990s, Nokia set the pace for building mobile networks around the world, and alongside that, it became the world\u2019s No. 1 handset maker.\n\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, however, it missed the boat in the shift to smartphones, which became dominated by Apple and Google (and Samsung and the hundreds of others building on Google\u2019s Android operating system). Some argued that one of Nokia\u2019s biggest failings was its inability to establish an extensible ecosystem for apps and third parties (and developers) to build for its smartphones. So it\u2019s interesting that it is now positioning itself as an enabler for that very purpose.\n\nSpecifically, Nokia sees an opportunity for carriers to encourage more developments on costly 5G networks that are now in place but in many cases underutilized.\n\nCarriers, they say, want more third parties building applications and other services on these networks, and they have launched a new \u201cNetwork as Code\u201d platform to that end. Rapid\u2019s API framework will exist as part of that initiative. Nokia said that carriers and other service providers signed up to the platform include BT, DISH, Google Cloud, Infobip, Orange, Telefonica, and Telecom Argentina, as well as 20 others.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to join forces with Nokia,\u201d Friend, the CEO of Rapid, said in a statement. \u201cThe combination of Rapid\u2019s API technology and R&D expertise with Nokia\u2019s scale and network and API domain expertise will enable us to expand the broader API ecosystem.\u201d\n\nUpdated with more detail on price."}
