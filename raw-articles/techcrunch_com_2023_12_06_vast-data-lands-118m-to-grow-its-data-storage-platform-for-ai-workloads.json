The way Hallak tells it, the co-founders shared a vision of creating a next-gen data management platform \u2014 one that leveraged commodity hardware to deliver faster access to bigger datasets for AI workloads.\n\nVast\u2019s founding team subsequently designed a new storage architecture and software infrastructure layer, operating in stealth until 2019, when the company began selling to customers.\n\nToday, Vast unifies storage, database and compute engine services in a platform built to power AI and GPU-accelerated workloads across datacenters and clouds. Customers can use Vast to manage unstructured and structured data across their preferred private, public or hybrid clouds \u2014 data ranging from videos and images to text, data streams and edge device data.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cStitching together legacy enterprise infrastructure is time-consuming and complex, and its inefficiencies make it an expensive endeavor,\u201d Hallak said. \u201cThe legacy cloud recipe for building AI infrastructure comprises disparate technologies that, due to their underlying architecture, don\u2019t take full advantage of modern technologies that offer improved performance, simplified operations and cost-savings \u2026 [And] without the right infrastructure in place, organizations can\u2019t efficiently enable their AI and GPU-powered investments with the data access needed for AI and deep learning.\u201d\n\nWhile Vast has competition in vendors like Databricks, Hallak asserts that it has substantial first-mover advantage. There\u2019s some truth to that it seems, judging by Vast\u2019s books.\n\nVast\u2019s annual recurring revenue now stands at $200 million and the company, which recently inked a strategic partnership with HPE, is growing 3.3x year over year, Hallak says. Cash flow has been positive for the last 12 months, while Vast\u2019s customer base has grown to include brands like Pixar and Zoom.\n\nNow with more than 700 employees worldwide, Vast plans to put the new tranche toward expanding its business reach, with an emphasis on Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Europe.\n\n\u201cVast is a software company that operates on commodity hardware, so the pandemic and supply chain issues that plagued many businesses in the last few years did not have a material impact on Vast or its partners and customers,\u201d Hallak said. \u201cWhile Vast has continued to grow, scale and operate efficiently, this new investment will further advance Vast\u2019s mission to deliver a new category of infrastructure that puts data at the center of how systems think, react and discover.\u201d"}
