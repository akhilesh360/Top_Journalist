The new umbrella is part of Anker\u2019s SOLIX lineup, which includes energy-efficient products like portable power stations and solar generators intended for powering home appliances during blackouts and emergencies.\n\nThough many solar-powered beach umbrellas are available on the market, Anker\u2019s product stands out due to its use of perovskite solar cells. According to the company, these cells offer 30% better performance than traditional crystalline silicon solar cells in bright light and double the efficiency in low light. As with any solar-powered device, these umbrellas can help contribute to reducing pollution and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. It\u2019s also a handy addition to your beach day packing list.\n\nImage Credits:Anker\n\nAnker announced this umbrella alongside several other new products at CES 2025, including the second generation of its EverFrost electric cooler and a karaoke speaker featuring an AI voice-removal function. The company likely hopes that customers will view the umbrella as a complementary accessory for the electronic cooler, as it can be attached to the cooler to power it. Alternatively, it can be installed with a stand-alone base.\n\nThe umbrella provides 80 watts of power to portable devices through USB-C. It can also power the EverFrost 2 or other compatible devices using an XT-60 connection, which links power from a battery to a motor or other electronics.\n\nAnker didn\u2019t disclose the cost of the umbrella, but it is expected to be available in the spring or summer."}
