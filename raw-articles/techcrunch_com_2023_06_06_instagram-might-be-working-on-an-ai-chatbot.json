When Snapchat first launched its My AI chatbot, powered by Open AI\u2019s GPT technology, the product lacked appropriate age-gating features. So, it ended up telling a reporter, who was using an account registered as a teenager, how to cover up the smell of alcohol and weed and set the mood for sex. Snapchat also recently released its paywalled My AI Snaps feature, which allows the AI to send you generated AI images. At launch, the product doesn\u2019t work very well.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But as generative AI booms, Instagram\u2019s parent company Meta has been using these tools in many established facets of its business, like ad sales. In May, Meta announced AI Sandbox, which helps advertisers create alternate versions of ads, as well as background images and image cropping. The company also unveiled its own AI coding tool called CodeCompose, but it\u2019s not available publicly.\n\nInstagram did not respond to request for comment before publication.\n\nWhile riding the AI hype train, Instagram is also rumored to be working on a Twitter competitor. According to leaked information about the text-based app, codenamed Barcelona, this will be a stand-alone app that integrates with Instagram. Instagram declined to comment on the accuracy of the rumors at the time but did not deny them. If the rumors are true, Instagram\u2019s Twitter clone should be coming this summer."}
