Mammoth received a contract to scale up its CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test in order to help address the testing shortages across the U.S.\n\nMammoth\u2019s CRISPR-based approach could potentially offer a significant solution to current testing bottlenecks, because it\u2019s a very different kind of test when compared to existing methods based on PCR technology. The startup has also enlisted the help of pharma giant GSK to develop and produce a new COVID-19 testing solution, which will be a handheld, disposable test that can offer results in as little as 20 minutes, on site.\n\nWhile that test is still in development, the RADx funding received through this funding will be used to scale manufacturing of the company\u2019s DETECTR platform for distribution and use in commercial laboratory settings. This will still offer a \u201cmulti-fold increase in testing capacity,\u201d the company says, even though it\u2019s a lab-based solution instead of a point-of-care test like the one it\u2019s seeking to create with GSK.\n\nAlready, UCSF has received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA to use the DETECTR reagent set to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and the startup hopes to be able to extend similar testing capacity to other labs across the U.S."}
