Its GAD device was approved just last week, and its device for insomnia received FDA clearance last October. More products are on the way, including a device for treating obesity-related cardiometabolic risk, which targets brain messaging that can influence the storage of harmful visceral fat. It\u2019s next in the pipeline.\n\nCEO Dr. Jason McKeown tells TechCrunch that Neurovalens is hoping to be granted an FDA \u201cde novo\u201d classification for a third noninvasive neurostimulating device \u2014 for people diagnosed with obesity \u2014 later this year or early next year. It\u2019s also working on another product for PTSD.\n\nIssues like chronic pain, depression, and anxiety or stress are often poorly handled by resource-strapped traditional healthcare services, and a growing number of startups are taking an interest in applying neurostimulation to treat a range of issues and chronic conditions. Pharmaceutical interventions have their own drawbacks, not least risks related to side effects, so noninvasive alternatives that are able to demonstrate efficacy and safety could be transformative and could also work in concert with drugs to dial up interventions. So there\u2019s huge potential, even as the field of noninvasive neurostimulation remains nascent and novel.\n\nNeurovalens has deliberately chosen to focus on selling regulator-cleared medical devices for specific conditions. This pathway requires it to conduct clinical trials to demonstrate significant results for particular use cases \u2014 rather than going direct to consumers with a marketing pitch composed of fuzzier \u201cwellness\u201d promises, for example \u2014 but it\u2019s a differentiating strategy, McKeown says. \u201cAs a consumer device, we wouldn\u2019t be allowed to make medical claims,\u201d he points out. \u201cSo it\u2019s really to differentiate ourselves as bona fide medical treatment for very, very, very specific conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2019, the FDA actually updated their regulations and specifically called out insomnia and anxiety because they knew that neurotechnology could potentially treat these things. In those two cases, we were actually allowed to do a 510(k) [FDA application]. But the restriction was that we had to do our own clinical trials,\u201d he said, referring to the process that the first two prescribable products had to go through.\n\nA 510(k) clearance refers to a type of FDA application where a medical device can be considered substantially similar to an existing device, rather than the more novel \u201cde novo\u201d classification, which future Neurovalens products targeting other conditions (i.e., not anxiety and insomnia) will need to obtain.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cTypically with a 510(k) you don\u2019t need clinical trials; you\u2019re kind of copying someone that\u2019s been there before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas the FDA were like, \u2018We don\u2019t feel anything that\u2019s come before has provided enough evidence. So we\u2019re asking them to redo their trials.\u2019 So we then took the guidance in 2019 and actually started then on our own trials. And, as far as I know, we\u2019re the first company globally who has gone through that process with the FDA and got the first approval in that category.\u201d\n\nConsumers in Europe, where regulations differ, are able to contact Neurovalens to purchase devices directly, according to McKeown. But he confirms the company is applying for medical device clearances in the U.K. and EU, too, saying it expects to get its first stamp of approval for doctors in Europe to prescribe its insomnia device as a treatment later this year.\n\nNeurovalens\u2019 products take the form of a head-mounted device that applies electrical neurostimulation to the skin behind the ear \u2014 directly targeting the vestibular nerve \u2014 as a route to stimulate the hypothalamus and associated autonomic nuclei of the brainstem.\n\nThe startup says these are areas of the brain that are responsible for functions like metabolic control, stress response and circadian regulation. The basic theory for how the mechanism works is that targeted stimulation can re-regulate the brain\u2019s control centers when areas are not functioning normally. (McKeown also says effects can be lasting, with users able to stop regular treatment after noticing positive change and switch to top-up treatments; it suggests four weeks of initial use to determine individual efficacy.)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this is a distinct approach to some other neurostimulation startups, such as those applying transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) or magnetic stimulation.\n\n\u201cWe are applying the minimum stimulation, but it\u2019s extremely specific,\u201d McKeown said. He argues that TDCS is less specific because it applies electricity to neurons on the surface of the brain, rather than going via the brainstem.\n\n\u201cWe know those nerve fibers carry signal into the deep area of the brain, which previously could only be accessed by an implant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like sending a signal down a USB cable or something \u2026 The cable itself is almost irrelevant as long as the signal gets from one end to the other. So we can start at the surface and push stimulation down the vestibular nerves, and we know that activates the neurons in the brainstem.\u201d\n\nThe vestibular system is typically associated with balance, but McKeown suggests it\u2019s been underestimated, saying it plays a critical role in \u201coverall homeostasis\u201d: helping regulating everything from blood pressure to breathing rate, heart rate or even how much fat the body stores.\n\nNeurovalens is the first company that\u2019s focused on noninvasive direct stimulation of the vestibular nerve, per McKeown. Although he notes there are startups attempting to develop noninvasive stimulation of the vagus nerve \u2014 another cranial nerve that links the brain with organs elsewhere in the body and plays a role in regulating various sensory and motor functions. This was an area Neurovalens also looked at, but decided it was too unreliable to target stimulation there given the presence of more soft tissue, muscle, etc. The vestibular nerve is essentially easier to get at.\n\n\u201cEvery cranial nerve stimulator is in our kind of seam area,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, in the general space, there are competitors in the noninvasive space, [but] specifically, we don\u2019t know of anyone who has device approval or regulatory approval for an anxiety treatment.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Neurovalens is also announcing a \u00a32.1 million ($2.65 million) top-up to its Series A funding round, with existing investors chipping in to kick off commercializing the new device in the U.S. market. McKeown says they\u2019ll begin the process of raising a Series B directly, targeting around $40 million for that round and aiming to close it out by the end of the year.\n\nSo far, Neurovalens has raised a total of \u00a323.1 million in equity funding from U.K.-based investors, including Wharton Asset Management, IQ Capital, Techstart Ventures, Angel Co Fund, Beltrae Partners, Clarendon Fund Managers and British Business Bank."}
