It is currently installing a network of 50 or so devices in San Francisco, a project the company says is largely funded by Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, with support of \u201clocal civic groups such as SF Parks Alliance and the Slow Streets Mayors.\u201d\n\nTelraam (the name is Dutch and means \u201ccounting window\u201d) claims its tech is particularly useful for \u201caddressing social issues\u201d and \u201ccreating valuable citizen engagement for transport authorities and urban planners.\u201d Traffic monitoring has been on the minds of urban planners and traffic wonks for a long time \u2014 TechCrunch published an impassioned plea for better data back in 2015, for example.\n\n\u201cThe pilot will demonstrate the quality of data that can be gathered in partnership with community groups to the SFMTA, saving them money and time, adding a greater level of detail than was available previously, and creating new channels of engagement with the residents involved,\u201d says Telraam\u2019s CEO Kris Vanherle. \u201cIf these 50 devices can demonstrate that Slow Streets are, or are not, performing as expected, and which ones and what interventions are most successful, then both the counting network and the Slow Street networks can be expanded.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco project represents the first deployment of the company\u2019s products outside of Europe \u2014 existing cities that are sensored up are Utrecht, Amsterdam, Berlin and Brussels. London is next.\n\nThe company says city planners need traffic data, but that the problem it is addressing has historically focused solely on motorized vehicle data on major roads. This is a challenge, because, of course, the urban traffic landscape is about more than cars, buses and the odd police car. By adding a focus on \u201clivable urban streets,\u201d the sensors also track walkers, bikers and other modes of transport.\n\nThe device is a camera sensor that detects moving objects from a residential window facing the street. It identifies the objects using machine learning and AI, then categorizes it along with the direction of travel and the speed (for vehicles). The anonymized data is then sent to Telraam servers. This creates an open data resource that is available to the device user on a dashboard but also to local network clients who monitor the devices in a particular area or region. From there, it\u2019s made public via the company\u2019s website map and API.\n\nPrivacy by design\n\nAs you might expect from a company based in Europe, which is becoming increasingly privacy-forward, Telraam has designed the device to be as private as possible. The low-resolution video images are processed on the device itself, then discarded, and the company says only the anonymized data table is transmitted off-device.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The quality is sufficient for the AI chip to process in order to recognize the moving objects and categorize them as a car, bike or pedestrian, for example, but not enough detail to be able to see a face or read a license plate. There is no chance to identify individuals or vehicles,\u201d says Vanherle. \u201cThis means that Telraam S2 devices can provide useful traffic counts, but not collect any private information on the street users who pass by.\u201d\n\nYou can check out the company\u2019s traffic map yourself on the company\u2019s website, and more industrial users can apply to gain access to an API to analyze the data in more detail.\n\n\u201cIndividual campaigners can purchase a device for their own window and monitor their street, and use this to lobby their neighbors and local community for change. Ultimately they can also encourage whoever makes policy or planning decisions locally to gather more data together, and collaborate on local improvements,\u201d Vanherle explains. \u201cTelraam also works with local authorities to help organize and coordinate local networks that can be from 10 to 300+ devices depending on the requirements, and then to support them as they recruit local volunteers.\u201d"}
