A majority of marketers report having already incorporated AI into their daily workflows, according to a recent survey by The Conference Board, and most expect further adoption of AI to improve productivity.\n\nTo wit, Pixis claims to have crossed the $50 million in an annual recurring revenue mark this quarter with a customer base eclipsing 200 brands, including DHL, Joe & The Juice, Sears and Swiggy. Having grown 140% year-over-year in 2023, Pixis expects to achieve profitability in Q4.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve observed a palpable shift in organizational priorities post-pandemic,\u201d Pixis co-founder and CEO Shubham Mishra told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThere\u2019s a heightened emphasis on maximizing profitability and ensuring sustainable growth. It\u2019s not merely about weathering the storm anymore, but about thriving in the new normal.\u201d\n\nYears ago, Mishra and Pixis\u2019 other co-founders, Hari Valiyath and Vrushali Prasade, met at the Birla Institute of Technology & Science in Pilani, Rajasthan, India. The three were researching generative AI, specifically AI to create art and model assets for games.\n\nBut once they realized how large the addressable market for AI in marketing was becoming, Mishra, Valiyath and Prasade decided to pivot. Together, they built a prototype to generate marketing assets, which caught the attention of a large bank chain. From there, Mishra, Valiyath and Prasade started laying the groundwork for a full-stack marketing platform for generating assets, dynamically targeting customers and monitoring the performance of campaigns in real time.\n\nThat full-stack solution became Pixis.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

On the creative end, meanwhile, Pixis can generate assets including texts, images and emails. And when it comes to performance, Pixis offers automated ad bid and budget pacing tools that attempt to mitigate the impact of short-term fluctuations and seasonality.\n\nEach brand that works with Pixis gets it own set of \u201ccustomized learnings\u201d trained on the brand\u2019s marketing unique data and objectives, Mishra says. Pixis uses these learnings to support its automation and creation tools, also structuring the learnings to deliver them back to the brand in the form of insights and strategies.\n\n\u201cWith our AI engines trained on a brand\u2019s performance data, Pixis distributes budgets, finds audiences and generates assets both within and across marketing partners,\u201d Mishra said. \u201cThis gives our customers the ability to find and execute delivery actions while dynamically allocating and reallocating spend, aligning the brand\u2019s media budget, target audience and creative assets around patterns discovered by our AI engines.\u201d\n\nNow, that\u2019s a lot of jargon. And this reporter wonders just how Pixis is applying generative AI to create marketing materials. After all, generative AI \u2014 whether in-house or third party \u2014 has a tendency to make up facts and go off the rails in other unexpected ways.\n\nMishra emphasized that Pixis has \u201cmanual overrides\u201d to steer its AI when necessary and that it takes a \u201cfine-tuning\u201d approach to better control the content that its models create. I\u2019d hope that Pixis encourages human oversight of the platform\u2019s generative AI features. But I can\u2019t be sure, having not been given the opportunity to test them myself.\n\nPixis seems intent to forge ahead on the AI front regardless, recently launching a chatbot tool called Pixis Analyze that lets users ask questions related to campaigns, marketing data and various \u201cAI actions.\u201d The company\u2019s larger, more ambitious project is Creative Studio, an editing suite for fine-tuning media output by its generative AI models. Creative Studio is available to Pixis\u2019 current brand partners and will launch for new customers next year, Mishra says.\n\n\u201cOur platform pays for itself and improves profitability through unlocked budget efficiencies and time savings that get reinvested back into the business,\u201d Mishra said. \u201cThe demand for efficient, scalable and customizable AI has surged, and our products align seamlessly with this new emerging need.\u201d\n\nMishra says that the proceeds from Pixis\u2019 latest funding round will be used to support Pixis\u2019 R&D, expand its infrastructure to reach more publishers and ad networks and build strategic product and business partnerships. In the near term, Pixis plans to expand its staff of 350 people, focusing on the sales and business development teams in North America and Latin America, and take on debt in Q4 for a potential acquisition. (Mum\u2019s the word on which business Pixis could acquire.)"}
