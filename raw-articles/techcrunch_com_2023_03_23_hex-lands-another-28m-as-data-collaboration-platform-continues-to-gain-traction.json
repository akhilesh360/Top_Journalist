It seems the days are gone when VC firms approach promising startups about funding instead of the other way around, but Hex, a data collaboration startup, has defied the odds.\n\nCompany co-founder and CEO Barry McCardel says he wasn\u2019t looking for funding when Sequoia came knocking on his door. The company ended up landing another $28 million from Sequoia, with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Amplify and Snowflake.\n\nMcCardel says he still hasn\u2019t touched the $52 million he had in the bank from his previous funding round last year. \u201cWe weren\u2019t raising, and didn\u2019t need the money \u2014 we hadn\u2019t touched a dime of the last round. But Matt Miller at Sequoia approached us preemptively with an offer that gave us very little dilution, and let us put another 2-3 years of runway in the bank,\u201d McCardel told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cThis felt like a no-brainer coming into a time when we want to be investing deeply in our product and team, especially around the AI opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the reasons for the investor interest is that the company has been growing at a rapid clip since its funding last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on a tear. I think from a top line business perspective, we\u2019ve grown revenue by 4x and the size of the business by 4x in one year, which has been great. We 10xed our user base because we launched a tier that just opened up access to a ton more people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo just the raw number of people using the product in the last year has been great. And I think that obviously caught the eye of new investors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company now has 450 paying customers including Brex, Notion, Toast and Chegg. He believes that the collaborative approach to data and the growing recognition that AI is transforming workflows are the biggest reasons for the product\u2019s growing popularity.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

He sees this as a way to expand the user base beyond folks like data scientists and people who know SQL or Python.\n\n\u201cOur product uniquely allows collaboration across different data personas. I think that\u2019s also really powerful. And I think the AI stuff is just accretive to that. You don\u2019t necessarily have to know how to write the perfect syntax in Python to do something because Hex can help you do that. So I think that\u2019s a pretty powerful thing that we\u2019ll just see become more and more important in terms of opening up [the platform] to more people,\u201d he said.\n\nHex was founded in 2019 and has now raised more than $100 million dollars in just four years, per Crunchbase data. With the most recent round of funding. McCardel says he should have five years of runway, setting his company up to ride out whatever economic uncertainty may be out there, while giving him the freedom to grow the platform as needed."}
