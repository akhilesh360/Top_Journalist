The large-scale experiment was designed to explore just how persuasive AI can be.\n\nThe bots posted over 1,700 comments, adopting personas like abuse survivors or controversial identities like an anti-Black Lives Matter advocate.\n\nFor Reddit, the incident was a mini-nightmare. Reddit\u2019s brand is associated with authenticity \u2014 a place where real people come to share real opinions. If that human-focused ecosystem is disturbed with AI slop or becomes a place where people can\u2019t trust that they\u2019re getting information from actual humans, it could do more than threaten Reddit\u2019s core identity. Reddit\u2019s bottom line could be at stake, since the company now sells its content to OpenAI for training.\n\nThe company condemned the \u201cimproper and highly unethical experiment\u201d and filed a complaint with the university that ran it. But that experiment was only one of what will likely be many instances of generative AI bots pretending to be humans on Reddit for a variety of reasons, from the scientific to the politically manipulative.\n\nTo protect users from bot manipulation and \u201ckeep Reddit human,\u201d the company has quietly signaled an upcoming action \u2014 one that may be unpopular with users who come to Reddit for another reason: anonymity.\n\nOn Monday, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman shared in a post that Reddit would start working with \u201cvarious third-party services\u201d to verify a user\u2019s humanity. This represents a significant step for a platform that has historically required almost no personal information for users to create an account.\n\n\u201cTo keep Reddit human and to meet evolving regulatory requirements, we are going to need a little more information,\u201d Huffman wrote. \u201cSpecifically, we will need to know whether you are a human, and in some locations, if you are an adult. But we never want to know your name or who you are.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The spokesperson also wouldn\u2019t share more details about which third-party services the company would use or what kind of personally identifying information users would have to offer up.\n\nMany companies today rely on verification platforms like Persona, Alloy, Stripe Identity, Plaid, and Footprint, which usually require a government-issued ID to verify age and humanity. Then there\u2019s the newer and more speculative tech, like Sam Altman\u2019s Tools for Humanity and its eye-scanning \u201cproof of human\u201d device.\n\nOpponents to ID checks say there are data privacy and security risks to sharing your personal information with social media platforms. That\u2019s especially true for a platform like Reddit, where people come to post experiences they maybe never would have if their names were attached to them.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to imagine a world in which authorities might subpoena Reddit for the identity of, for example, a pregnant teen asking about abortion experiences on r/women in states where it is now illegal. Just look how Meta handed over private conversations between a Nebraska woman and her 17-year-old daughter, which discussed the latter\u2019s plans to terminate a pregnancy. Meta\u2019s assistance led law enforcement to acquire a search warrant, which resulted in felony charges for both the mother and daughter.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the risk Reddit hopes to avoid by tapping outside firms to provide \u201cthe essential information and nothing else,\u201d per Huffman, who emphasized that \u201cwe never want to know your name or who you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnonymity is essential to Reddit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CEO also noted that Reddit would continue to be \u201cextremely protective of your personal information\u201d and \u201cwill continue to push back against excessive or unreasonable demands from public or private authorities.\u201d"}
