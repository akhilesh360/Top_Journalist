But Unbound Academy\u2019s application, which proposes an \u201cAI-driven adaptive learning technology\u201d that \u201ccondenses academic instruction into a two-hour window,\u201d is a first for the model. (Unbound\u2019s founders have been running a similar program at a \u201chigh-end private school\u201d in Texas, which appears to be in-person.)\n\nUnbound\u2019s approach leans on edtech platforms like IXL and Khan Academy, and students engage with \u201cinteractive, AI-powered platforms that continuously adjust to their individual learning pace and style.\u201d There will be humans, just fewer of them, and maybe not actual accredited teachers: It will adopt a \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d approach with \u201cskilled guides\u201d monitoring progress who can provide \u201ctargeted interventions\u201d and coaching for each student.\n\nAcademic instruction is whittled down to just two hours. The remainder of the students\u2019 day will include \u201clife-skills workshops\u201d covering areas such as critical thinking, creative problem-solving, financial literacy, public speaking, goal setting, and entrepreneurship. The online-only school targets students from fourth to eighth grades."}
