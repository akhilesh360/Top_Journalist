Zhavoronkov explained to TechCrunch that the last round \u201cwas very substantial and was intended to allow us to fund clinical development\u201d and the company is \u201ctrying to be very conservative and careful with the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still have a substantial amount of cash from the previous round and this round extended our runway and will allow us to continue innovating and growing,\u201d the founder added.\n\n\u201cRight now the market is in \u2018biotechnology winter\u2019 where many companies are running out of cash and are dying. This presents an opportunity for Insilico Medicine to emerge as a winner during the biotech spring.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nInsilico focused exclusively on drug discovery until 2019 when it began developing its own therapeutics in areas like fibrosis, immunology, oncology and the central nervous system. It has nominated eight preclinical candidates since 2021.\n\nThe firm plans to spend its proceeds from investment on conducting Phase I studies, the clinical trial stage that primarily tests for safety, and further developing its drug discovery platform, which uses AI to identify new targets and molecules. The capital will also go toward funding Insilico\u2019s global expansion and \u201cstrategic initiatives\u201d, which include a \u201crobotic drug discovery laboratory\u201d and a \u201crobotic biological data factory.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cprototype\u201d lab will be located in Suzhou, an affluent eastern Chinese city adjoining Shanghai with favorable government policies for attracting biotech and autonomous driving startups. The lab, according to Zhavoronkov, will be equipped with autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), now a common sight in advanced logistics facilities. It will also partner with imaging company X-Imaging to conduct phenotyping, the process of determining the physical properties of an organism.\n\nInsilico is headquartered in Hong Kong, which has in recent years emerged as an attractive hub for biotech startups. In 2018, the city introduced new rules that cleared some hurdles for pre-revenue biotech startups to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Setting up a base in Hong Kong also allows companies to gain potential access to China\u2019s enormous market for biotech innovation.\n\nInsilico has its own Chinese partner \u2014 pharmaceutical behemoth Fosun Pharma. The two inked a partnership in January this year to work on drug discovery and development through a profit-sharing scheme. As part of the deal, Insilico also received an equity investment from Fosun Pharma, which has financed over 60 startups, according to startup database IT Juzi.\n\nEight-year-old Insilico is in the \u201cR&D\u201d stage and isn\u2019t profitable yet, Zhavoronkov said. It generates revenue through R&D collaborations, including upfront payments and milestones, and customer subscriptions to its AI drug discovery platform. It counts 200 employees across six countries and regions."}
