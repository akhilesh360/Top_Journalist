Researchers at Google DeepMind published a demonstration of miniature humanoid robots playing a one-on-one game of soccer. Training Robotis OP3, the researchers found they were able to learn movement skills like walking, kicking, and being able to recover from a fall. According to the report, the robots were also able to develop an understanding of the rules of soccer, like anticipating where the ball is going or when to block shots from an opponent."}
