The company is also expanding its AR beauty and virtual try-on tools.\n\nThe new feature, \u201cVision Match,\u201d is now available in the search experience on mobile for U.S. users. It lets shoppers describe a garment they\u2019re imagining, and then the AI suggests ideas based on the description, along with the best available matches that users can purchase.\n\nTo try this feature, type an idea into the search bar and scroll to the \u201cCan\u2019t find it? Create it\u201d prompt or go to the left panel in the Shopping tab and select \u201cCreate & Shop.\u201d\n\nVision Match has been available to testers as an experimental feature in Labs since 2023.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nIn addition to this announcement, Google revealed that it\u2019s launching the ability to use its AR beauty feature with multiple makeup products simultaneously. This week, U.S. users can try on and shop for various lipsticks, mascaras, eyeshadows, and eyeliners from a range of brands, including E.L.F., Fenty, Glossier, and more.\n\nTo use the AR beauty capability, mobile users can search things like \u201csoft glam,\u201d a trendy makeup look, and then select \u201cSee the looks on you\u201d and \u201cTry it on,\u201d to then virtually wear neutral eyeshadows, rosy blush, lip gloss, and more.\n\nGoogle is also expanding its virtual try-on experience, which was introduced in 2023 to let customers see how garments look on different models.

For example, when searching for a winter jacket, Google gives users essential tips to consider before making a purchase for the season."}
