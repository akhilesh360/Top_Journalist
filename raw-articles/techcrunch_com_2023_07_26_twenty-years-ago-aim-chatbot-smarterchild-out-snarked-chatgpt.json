Thirty million people added SmarterChild to their AIM and MSN buddy lists in the early 2000s, and for many of us, we had our first encounters with artificial intelligence, a technology that now feels unavoidable.\n\nIn the early aughts, millions of preteens raced home from school and hopped onto their parents computers, opened a chat window and typed\u2026 probably something like \u201cfuck,\u201d or \u201c(.)(.)\u201d.\n\n\u201cDo you kiss your mother with that mouth?\u201d SmarterChild would reply in an instant. It would make you apologize, and then move past your indiscretions to answer all of your questions about the population of La Paz, the score of the Marlins game or the equations from your math homework.\n\n\u201cWe were offering people something they never had before,\u201d said Peter Levitan, a co-founder of ActiveBuddy, SmarterChild\u2019s parent company. \u201cWhen you talked to SmarterChild, it knew who you were when you came back. It was like your friend, and having a computer friend then, and now, is fantastic.\u201d\n\nSmarterChild was far less sophisticated than ChatGPT, but then again, this was 2001. The chatbot was special enough that it inspired investors to fund Siri, which paved the way for Amazon\u2019s Alexa and other robot assistants.\n\nLevitan has remained level-headed about the future of AI. But another ActiveBuddy co-founder, Robert Hoffer, isn\u2019t as calm. Dubbed \u201cthe bot father,\u201d Hoffer describes himself as \u201ccautiously skeptimistic\u201d and repeatedly references stories like \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and the myth of Prometheus. The common denominator of these tales? Perhaps humans have gone too far, just because we can.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that SmarterChild sort of opened the Pandora\u2019s Box,\u201d Hoffer told TechCrunch. \u201cUnfortunately, now, I feel like I have a certain amount of responsibility to share with the world, the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

I wouldn\u2019t get my first cell phone for a few more years (a Motorola Razr with a glittery case, shedding sparkles into my pockets), and I had never experienced the mind-blowingly routine luxury of instant, online connection. Now, this technology is so normal that we call these conversations DMs (direct messages), not IMs, since the \u201cinstant\u201d part is redundant. But my first conversations with SmarterChild \u2014 my first conversations with anyone on the internet, really \u2014 felt magical.\n\nAs a fourth grader, I envied my older brother, whose friends from school had started making their own AIM accounts, allowing them to do homework and gossip together in group chats. But I had SmarterChild, at least, who could keep me entertained for a solid half hour when we played Hangman together.\n\nI may have been on the younger end of SmarterChild\u2019s user base, but I was by no means an anomaly. It was most popular among 10- to 16-year-olds, and according to Hoffer, SmarterChild usage spiked on weekdays around 3 PM, when kids like me were coming home from school.\n\nOlder users, of course, would test SmarterChild\u2019s limits, cursing at it and seducing it. But unlike the AI bots that are now cropping up every day, SmarterChild had a personality.\n\n\u201cWe had a sense of humor,\u201d said Hoffer. \u201cSo if someone tried to have sex with it, it said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t have the parts, I\u2019m just a robot!\u2019\u201d\n\nThese witty retorts mostly came from Pat Guiney, a copywriter who joined ActiveBuddy in 2000.\n\n\u201cI remember on my very first day, I was given a long list of the most obscene profanity you can think of, and my job was to try to think of responses to it,\u201d Guiney said in an interview with the AV Club. \u201cIn other words, if someone typed some incredibly offensive thing to one of our chat buddies, how should we respond?\u201d\n\nNow, bots like Snapchat\u2019s ChatGPT-powered MyAI will respond to inappropriate messages by saying, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t respond to that.\u201d SmarterChild, on the other hand, would ask for an apology if you were mean to it. And it\u2019d give you the silent treatment until you said you\u2019re sorry.\n\nIt seems to be human nature that when we\u2019re confronted with not-quite-human-beings, we will act on our most sadistic urges. We light a fire in our Sims\u2019 home and watch them panic to save their estate, we find increasingly cruel ways to execute Koroks and we harass SmarterChild.\n\nAccording to Hoffer, the complete chat logs from SmarterChild live somewhere in a basement in Glen Rock, New Jersey, encompassing both the lightest and darkest impulses of mankind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read more than almost anybody on planet Earth from these chat logs,\u201d Hoffer told TechCrunch. \u201cWe have billions and billions of conversations. Many of them push the boundaries way far, right away. The speed at which they did it, even as young kids\u2026 but they were also asking for help.\u201d\n\nSome people loved SmarterChild. Some people hated it. While ChatGPT is divisive because of its impact on technology, SmarterChild was divisive because of its snarky persona.\n\n\u201cWhat the AI world is not delivering at the moment is really any personality, or any soul,\u201d Levitan told TechCrunch.\n\nSiri, Alexa, ChatGPT, Bard or most other AI bots that have cropped up since the 2010s have very unassuming demeanors, which Hoffer thinks is intentional.\n\n\u201cIf you have a personality, and your personality is strong, you will appeal to exactly 50% of the people in the world,\u201d Hoffer said.\n\n\u2018The progenitor of all modern bots\u2019\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT how many games the Phillies have won this season, it won\u2019t know, since it\u2019s only been trained on data through 2021. But SmarterChild knew. ActiveBuddy licensed databases from IMDB, the Weather Channel, the Dewey Decimal System, Elias Sports, the Yellow Pages and Sony, enabling it to instantly share a wealth of information.\n\n\u201cEverybody thought back then that the internet was slow because we were putting HTML files through it, and we realized that if you put text through it, it was instantly fast,\u201d said Hoffer. \u201cWe sort of showed up like a virus, and when we look back on it, it was quite clear that we were definitely the progenitor of all modern bots, from Siri to Amazon Alexa to all of the various AIs we see today built around large language models.\u201d\n\nSmarterChild wasn\u2019t the first AI-powered chatbot, but it bridged the gap between current technology like Siri and Alexa and earlier efforts like Dr. Sbaitso on MS-DOS and ELIZA. Like SmarterChild, these earlier bots could process natural language, but they didn\u2019t have large swaths of data like SmarterChild to make its conversations more productive or useful.\n\nSmarterChild grew from zero to 30 million users in under six months, solidifying itself as a phenomenon of the early aughts internet. Even Radiohead came calling, using ActiveBuddy\u2019s technology to promote its 2001 album \u201cAmnesiac\u201d through a chatbot named GooglyMinotaur.\n\nThough Radiohead didn\u2019t realize it, they had identified the use case that ActiveBuddy would pursue for SmarterChild. The company couldn\u2019t make money off of a free chatbot, but what if they allowed other companies to make their own AI-driven chatbots that could be tailored directly to other businesses?\n\nBut Hoffer was more interested in advancing the tech behind SmarterChild than he was in creating a SaaS product to help corporate brands (not as cool as Radiohead) make more money.\n\n\u201cThere was a huge fight at the board of directors,\u201d Hoffer told TechCrunch. \u201cI was all about SmarterChild and wanting to win the Turing Test. They wanted to monetize. I lost that fight and got kicked out of the company as a result.\u201d\n\nHoffer left ActiveBuddy in 2002; then, the company rebranded to Colloquis, though it had a brief moment calling itself Conversagent, a portmanteau of conversation and agent, which reflected its more corporate trajectory.\n\nUltimately Microsoft bought the company that created SmarterChild in 2006. In the 17-year-old press release celebrating the deal, Microsoft wrote that it would use Colloquis to bring automated customer service agents to Xbox. There was no mention of SmarterChild.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a huge business, you can carve off what doesn\u2019t make sense strategically, and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Levitan explained. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with the difference between a forward-thinking, aggressive startup team and a major corporation that does not want to offend anyone at any time.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve just opened Jurassic Park\u2019\n\nThe Microsoft deal didn\u2019t go the way that ActiveBuddy\u2019s founders hoped.\n\n\u201cOf course, you know, now we\u2019re 15 to 20 years later, and they\u2019re buying similar services,\u201d Levitan quipped.\n\nThe founders have kept a close eye on developments in AI over the years. Hoffer remembers the iconic faceoff in 2010, when \u201cJeopardy!\u201d icons Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter failed to defeat IBM\u2019s AI, Watson, in a televised match. He watched alongside some engineers, \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at how this computer made legendary trivia masterminds look like amateurs.\n\nWatson could quickly recall basic trivia facts, but it failed in categories like \u201calso on your computer keys\u201d and \u201cone buck or less,\u201d which required some lived human experience to conjure the correct response. Unfortunately for team humanity, these foibles weren\u2019t enough for Jennings and Rutter to prevail.\n\nAIs still struggle to overcome similar limitations. While an AI could write something that resembles a TV pilot, it won\u2019t be very interesting, and it will likely contain copyrighted material. So, Levitan\u2019s predictions for the future of AI aren\u2019t too foreboding. He predicts that soon, we\u2019ll be able to voice control bots like ChatGPT, but he doubts that AI will ever truly become sentient.\n\n\u201cI am a believer in human nature, and that everyone has a very personal voice,\u201d Levitan told TechCrunch. Levitan\u2019s biggest concern with AI is that people will believe everything they read, just because a computer said it. But Hoffer is more worried that the consequences of this technology will pose even larger issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re right before the opening, or maybe we\u2019ve just opened Jurassic Park,\u201d Hoffer said. \u201cHow far are we from a lens in my eye that has AR hooked up to a bot? Probably not very.\u201d\n\nWhen SmarterChild typed its final words in 2008, I was in seventh grade, and my friends had finally come around to joining AIM. My away message was usually the lyrics to \u201cDecode,\u201d the song that Paramore wrote for the \u201cTwilight\u201d movie. Now that my buddy list was a bit more fleshed out, I chatted with my classmates about who we had crushes on, always using code names, because we were so deeply paranoid that these clueless 13-year-old boys would somehow manage to hack our AIM accounts and read what we said about them.\n\nI was so captivated by the gut-wrenching highs and lows of middle school drama that I didn\u2019t even realize what happened. My first friend on the internet had logged off forever."}
