The new ad buying type dubbed the \u201cSearch Ads Toggle\u201d will allow advertisers to target the platform\u2019s users who are specifically seeking to learn more about new products or brands by typing queries into the app\u2019s search box.\n\nThis is TikTok\u2019s first ad placement that lets brands target users engaged with searches related to the brand\u2019s business. However, the Search Ads Toggle is an extension of an advertiser\u2019s TikTok video ad buy \u2014 and is not a standalone ad product.\n\nThe company also promises brand safety as a part of this offering, noting that the advertisers have the option to add \u201cNegative Keywords\u201d to each ad group which allows them to avoid having their ad served against queries that don\u2019t align with their brand.\n\nAccording to internal tests run in July, 70% of ad groups with the Search Ads Toggle set to \u201con\u201d saw a lower cost per action (CPA) thanks to more efficient conversions from the ad placement, TikTok claims. The company had been testing these ads since last year.\n\nEarly testers include brands like Clinique and DIBS Beauty. Clinique saw a 441% increase in conversation rates, a 51% increase in click-through rates and a 7.4% lift in ad recall, TikTok says. In addition, DIBS saw an 8% higher conversion volume, a 6x higher conversion rate and a 22% decrease in CPA compared to their non-search ads.\n\nThe addition of the ad slot could also pose a challenge to Google\u2019s search ads business, given that the search giant even admitted that younger users today are now often starting their searches on social apps like TikTok and Instagram, not on Google.\n\n\u201cIn our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they\u2019re looking for a place for lunch, they don\u2019t go to Google Maps or Search,\u201d Google Senior Vice President Prabhakar Raghavan said at a conference last year. \u201cThey go to TikTok or Instagram.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It\u2019s also not yet clear how well these search ads will perform, when compared with more traditional ad buys that marketers are used to. Still, given the influence of TikTok on users\u2019 shopping behavior, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see more brands experiment with this offering in the months to come.\n\n\u201cSearch, among many other functions on TikTok, empowers users to discover diverse content, communities, brands, and products on TikTok,\u201d said Ray (Jiayi) Cao, TikTok\u2019s global head of Monetization Product Solution & Operation, in a statement about the launch. \u201cThe Search Ads Toggle gives advertisers a new ad placement where qualified, high-intent users are searching for content relevant to their business, allowing advertisers to further connect with the TikTok community in authentic and engaging ways,\u201d he added."}
