It\u2019s made of silicon and covered with elastic rubber. The scientists involved in the project say their sensor can detect pressure and friction of objects weighing just 1g.\n\nExisting tactile sensors are too large to be implanted into robot hands but this new device can be embedded underneath a robot\u2019s fingers, just like human nerves.\n\nCommercialization of the sensor is scheduled to begin \u201cin a few years\u201d. Matsushita and the university are specifically planning to use their technology in robots engaged in nursing care and household work.\n\nVia Nikkei [registration required, paid subscription]"}
