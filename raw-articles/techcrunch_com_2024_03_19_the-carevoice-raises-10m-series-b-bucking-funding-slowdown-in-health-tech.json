About 7 years ago, early insurtech companies promised to disrupt the insurance industry with new tech, but today, most of those companies have either been acquired or are floundering in the public markets.\n\nFortunately, insurtech has found a new wave to ride in the past couple of years: \u201cembedded insurance.\u201d Insurance startups have found success in helping third-party companies \u201cembed\u201d insurance products into their customer journeys to improve sales and retention \u2014 instead of buyers actively seeking coverage, insurance might appear as an add-on at the time of customers\u2019 flight purchases, for example. Investors seem to be excited about this model, too, though they have made it clear that good economics and healthy traction are crucial factors for startups in the space today.\n\nNow, an adjacent \u2014 and new \u2014 category has emerged and attracted investor attention: embedded health. While embedded insurance bundles insurance solutions with existing services, embedded health integrates health functionalities, like fitness and wellness, into a single platform run by service providers, especially insurers.\n\nThe former is a distribution play, while the latter emerges as a response to increasing demand for personalized health needs.\n\nThe CareVoice is one of the active players in this new sector. Started in Shanghai a decade ago, the embedded health company now has a footprint across 15 countries. It just raised $10 million from a Series B financing led by U.K.-based Apis Insurtech Fund I, which contributed to most of the round. The investment brings the company\u2019s total capital raised to around $20 million.\n\nThat\u2019s notable, given how much venture investment in startups has slowed down in the past year. In 2023, U.S.-based digital health startups raised a total of $10.7 billion across 492 deals, the lowest amount since 2019, according to Rock Health, a health tech\u2013focused seed fund.\n\nThat funding slowdown also hit The CareVoice, though it weathered the storm by reaching healthy cash flow. By mid-2022, the company had already received funding commitments for its Series B. But right as the market turned around then, one of its investors became \u201cvaluation sensitive\u201d and greatly reduced the startup\u2019s revenue multiple, co-founder and CEO Sebastien Gaudin told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But Gaudin feels that health providers that opt to outsource their software needs will eventually realize the significant \u201ccost and time\u201d involved with \u201climited outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be two years, three years before [customers] see anything. And [in terms of] cost, it\u2019s like several million dollars. Then they\u2019ll be stuck. The health system management remains out of the scope, meaning that in the end, those custom software companies are not going to manage different health technologies, partner with them, and bring them in,\u201d he said.\n\nGaudin says The CareVoice can make the first version of a health tech solution live in as little as three months, with the design process taking two to four weeks and development requiring another two months. \u2060For one of its biggest clients MetLife, the startup enables the insurer\u2019s 360Health app with functionalities like illness detection through face scanning and access to a network of nearby checkup centers, as well as prevention across physical, mental and cognitive wellness.\n\nOperating with a team of around 40 employees, The CareVoice plans to spend its fresh funding on expanding partnerships with insurers across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, as well as investing in the next generation of CareVoiceOS, an operating system it has built for insurers.\n\nThe story was updated on March 20, 2024, to clarify that The CareVoice is an embedded health startup."}
