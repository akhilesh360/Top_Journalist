This goes beyond just the content on websites; whole domains can expire and be taken over, allowing corners of the internet to become a little like your hometown: Wait, wasn\u2019t there a Dairy Queen here?\n\nFor example, if TechCrunch forgets to pay its domain registrar, TechCrunch.com would eventually expire (on June 10, to be exact). At that point, some enterprising human could snap up the domain and do nefarious things with it. Now, if TechCrunch.com was suddenly red instead of green and sold penis enhancement pills instead of dicking around with great news and awful puns in equal measure, you\u2019d probably figure out that something is up. But black-hat SEO tricksters are subtler than that.\n\nWhen they seize a domain, they\u2019ll often point the web domain to a new IP address, resurrect the site, restore it to as close as it can to the original and leave it for a while. When the IP address changes, SEO experts claim that Google temporarily \u201cpunishes\u201d the domain by dropping it in the rankings.\n\nThis is called \u201csandboxing,\u201d or \u201cthe sandbox period,\u201d and during this time, Google puts the domain on notice. Once Google determines \u2014 sometimes erroneously \u2014 that the IP address change underneath the domain was just part of a move from one web host to another, the theory is that the domain will start climbing in the rankings again. That\u2019s when the new owner of the domain can start their sneaky business: Updating links to send traffic to new places for example, or keeping the traffic as it is and adding affiliate links to make money off its visitors. At the far end of the scamming spectrum, they can use the good name and reputation of the original business to scam or trick users.\n\nSince the invention of PageRank in 1996, Google has been relying in part on the transferability of trust to determine what makes a good website. A site that is linked to by a lot of high-trust websites can, generally, be trusted. Links from that page can, in turn, be used as a measure of trust as well. Massively simplified, it boils down to this: The more links from high-quality sites a page has, the more it is trusted, and the better it ranks in the search engines.\n\nWhile bad actors can take advantage of this fact, it\u2019s also just something that happens on the internet \u2014 sites move from one host to another all the time for perfectly legitimate reasons. As Google\u2019s Search Liaison, Danny Sullivan, pointed out when I talked to him about expired domains last week, TechCrunch itself has had a few changes of owners over the years, from AOL, to Oath, to Verizon Media, to Yahoo, which itself was bought by Apollo Global Management last year. Every time that that happens, there\u2019s a chance that the new corporate overlords want to move stuff to new servers or new technology, which means that the IP addresses will change.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

[Google] can understand if domain names change ownership,\u201d Sullivan said, pointing out that it\u2019s also possible for the content to change without the underlying architecture or network topography shifting. \u201cThe site could rebrand, but just because it rebranded itself doesn\u2019t mean that the basic functions of what it was doing had changed.\u201d\n\nThe buying and selling of expired domains\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look far to find places to buy expired domains. Serp.Domains, Odys, Spamzilla and Juice Market are some of the most active in the business. (As a side note, I stuck a rel=\"nofollow\" on all three of those links in the HTML of this article. They ain\u2019t getting TechCrunch\u2019s sweet, sweet link juice on my watch; as Google notes in its developer documentation; \u201cUse the nofollow value when \u2026 you\u2019d rather Google not associate your site with \u2026 the linked page.\u201d)\n\n\u201cGet expired domains that have naturally gained (almost impossible to get) authoritative backlinks since they were actual businesses,\u201d Odys advertises on its site, adding that they \u201care aged and out of the sandbox period by a mile, [and] already have organic, referral & direct, type-in traffic.\u201d\n\nThese domains are listed for sale for anything from a few hundred bucks to thousands of dollars. Seeing the sites disappear from the \u201cfor sale\u201d list and then pop up on the internet shows that some of these domains end up ethically dubious at best and scams at worst.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to determine why so-called \u201cblack hat SEO\u201d folks are willing to go through all the trouble: Building a domain from scratch, filling it with high-quality content, waiting for people to link to it and doing everything by the book takes for-flippin\u2019-ever. Finding a shortcut that shaves months, if not years, off the process and adds the ability to make a quick buck? There will always be people who are willing to go for that sort of thing.\n\n\u201cGoogle has named inbound links as one of their top three ranking factors,\u201d explained Patrick Stox, a product adviser at Ahrefs. \u201cContent is going to be the most important, but your relevant links will provide a strength metric for them.\u201d\n\nWhat the spammers are doing\n\nThe spammers buy a domain that was recently expired and use a search engine optimization (SEO) tool like Ahrefs to gauge how valuable the site is; it checks how many links are going to the site and how valuable those links are. A link from TechCrunch or the BBC or WhiteHouse.gov would be highly valuable, for example. A link from a random blog post on Medium.com is probably less so.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve found and bought a domain, they\u2019ll use something like the WayBack Machine to copy an old version of the site, stick it on a server somewhere, and \u2014 voila! \u2014 the site is back. Obviously, that\u2019s both trademark and copyright infringement, but if you\u2019re in the market of spamming or scamming, that\u2019s probably the least of your crimes against human decency, never mind the letter of the law.\n\nOver time \u2014 sometimes weeks, sometimes months \u2014 Google un-sandboxes the domain and is effectively tricked into accepting the domain as the original. Traffic will start picking up, and black-hat SEO wizards are ready for the next phase of their plan: selling stuff or tricking people. There are whole guides for what to do next in order to use these domains, including checking whether there are trademarks registered and redirecting either the full domain or specific pages on the domain using a so-called 301 redirect (\u201cmoved permanently\u201d).\n\n\u201cWhen a site drops off the internet [Google is] just going to drop all the signals from the links. That typically happens anyway when a page expires. Where it\u2019s more complicated is going to be whether any of those signals will come back for a new owner. I don\u2019t think [Google has] ever really answered this in a very clear way,\u201d Stox explained. \u201cBut if the same site with the same type of content \u2014 or very similar content \u2014 comes back, it is more than likely the links are going to start counting again. If you were a site about technology and now suddenly you\u2019re a food blog, all of the previous stuff will likely be ignored.\u201d\n\nAs with all things in SEO, however, not everything is cut and dried; it turns out that negative signals continue on expired domains, so it stands to reason that positive signals do, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because sometimes penalties will still carry over, regardless of the content of the new site,\u201d Stox said. \u201cSo certain things may still factor in. There\u2019s a giant list of Google penalties \u2014 such as backlink spam, content spam, paid links, etc. They can carry on to the new site, and sometimes people will buy \u2026 an expired domain and put a new site up. Nothing is ranking, and on closer inspection, they\u2019ll find a penalty set in inside Google Search Console.\u201d\n\nSullivan reassured us that the search engine giant knows what\u2019s going on and that it has a handle on things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just fair to say that all purchased sites are spam and that they, therefore, should be treated as spam,\u201d said Sullivan, pointing out that the company\u2019s robust spam filters are there to protect searchers. \u201cWhen actual spam happens, we have a whole ton of spam-fighting systems we have in place. There are millions and millions, if not hundreds of millions of [pages and sites] that we\u2019re constantly keeping out of the top search results. One metaphor I like to use for people to understand just how much work we do on spam is this: If you go into your email spam folder, you go, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t see all these emails.\u2019 That is stuff that existed but didn\u2019t show up because your system said, \u2018No, this isn\u2019t really relevant for you. This is spam.\u2019 That\u2019s what\u2019s happening on search all the time. If we didn\u2019t have robust spam filters in place, our search results would look like what you see in your spam folder. There\u2019s so much spam and our systems are in place to catch it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Google does a lot to defend us from spam, and yet there\u2019s a thriving industry for high-value expired domains that are available, whether for honest attempts at corner-cutting or more nefarious deeds.\n\nA thriving industry\n\nYou don\u2019t have to dig very deep to find examples of domains that, at first glance, look legitimate, but that have been sneakily shifted to another purpose. Here are a few I came across.\n\nOne example is the Paid Leave Project, which used to live on paidleaveproject.org, but moved its site to USpaidleave.org at some point. Unfortunately, someone at the org didn\u2019t renew and/or redirect the old domain, and the site that used to work hard to ensure that workers in the U.S. can get paid family leave is now, well \u2026 helping families grow in different ways:\n\nAnother tragic story is Genome Mag, which ran from 2013 to 2016, expired, and then came back online as a different magazine that the original owner doesn\u2019t have control over.\n\n\u201cGenome Magazine was a print and digital offering. When the magazine closed in 2018, the previous owner retained ownership of the trademarks, content, archive, etc. At the end of last year, we had the opportunity to buy the content back,\u201d explained Sam Solomon, the creative director at Genome. \u201cWe went ahead with that, not realizing that sometime between 2018 and last year, the domain had expired, [been purchased], and the entire content archive of our content was put back up. They cloned the entire site and moved it to a new host. We didn\u2019t know \u2014 for all intents and purposes, the content appeared the same; it seemed exactly as when we left it. We have spent months trying to regain control of the domain, unsuccessfully. It is hosted on Epik.\u201d\n\nEpik is a web host that is known for being a little laissez-faire about the pages it hosts, to describe it kindly. If we are less kind, we\u2019d note that Epik hosts troves of neo-Nazi and white supremacist content, with a particularly outspoken CEO and a set of tools designed specifically for \u201cbackorder domains\u201d \u2014 Epik\u2019s term for snagging a domain as it expires.\n\n\u201cFor us, the first step was to file a DMCA complaint with the host,\u201d said Solomon, referring to the process of filing a copyright complaint with a web host. For most professional hosting companies, these are processed in three to five days. \u201cWe have not had any response \u2026 even after providing what they asked; all the legal paperwork and all that sort of thing. The next step is probably to go the legal course. My understanding is that a DMCA notice should be taken fairly seriously. Especially when it could be hundreds of instances of copyright infringement. Yeah. So hopefully there\u2019s a resolution. I just don\u2019t quite know what that is.\u201d\n\nWhen the site popped back up, it included a few hundred pages of the original content, which the team said was insulting enough. Worse, the content was now monetized with advertisements that the original Genome team is rather uncomfortable with.\n\n\u201cWe built this beautiful media company with award-winning content and a great magazine. We invested a lot \u2026 a website that resonated with folks, and we had a quarterly magazine, so we also put a lot of original content on the site. The site was ranking really high on Google,\u201d explained Susan McClure, founder and publisher of Genome Magazine. \u201cThe content was still there. And then we discovered these ads on there that we never would have allowed. When I visited our site recently to revisit a story we had published about privacy protections around our DNA and the identifiable information contained within it, I was shocked to see ads about infidelity and toenail fungus.\u201d\n\nThe new owners of the Genome domain did not respond to multiple attempts to contact them for an interview.\n\nGenome\u2019s story is unfortunate. Letting a domain expire is, ultimately, the responsibility of whoever is in charge of renewing the domains. It is having a profound effect on Genome as a business (and, of course, the alleged copyright and trademark infringement is problematic), but in a broader sense, it\u2019s a challenge for Google. If sites are ranking well on the reputation of the old owners, it can erode the trust people have in Google as a search engine.\n\nIf Genome and the Paid Leave Project were the only issues here, it would be concerning, but isolated. However, there are hundreds of examples of sites that Ahrefs data suggests are ranking well and serving advertisements. Here\u2019s a small selection:\n\nWhy this is such a problem\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s particularly unfortunate that the above activities are possible \u2014 and that the sites are relying on search engines and direct-link traffic from unsuspecting site visitors. Meanwhile, Google continues the fight against the myriad ways that people are trying to trick the search engine into sending traffic their way.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the year, we do about 5,000 updates to how search operates. On any given day, we could have one, two, or more that are happening. And some of those may improve the ways that we try to better catch spam. But we also have some really major [changes],\u201d Sullivan explained, pointing out that the search engine long ago made a significant change to how it treats expired domains.\n\n\u201cIf someone brings back a site that operates and looks just like [it] did before, hopefully our systems are still going to work well enough that we\u2019re not going to be showing new content or content that isn\u2019t as good as it can be,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cOne challenge you might have is if the site was there before and had really good content, it might still be helpful content. If they create a new page on the site about something completely different, that new page still has to work on its own. Our systems are designed on a page-by-page kind of basis. Just because you create this new page and put it up on some new site, it\u2019s a new page, and it\u2019s got a new URL we have to understand it on its own merits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the power of its brand, trust is the only thing Google has. When you do a Google search \u2014 it\u2019s a verb, for goodness\u2019 sake \u2014 you expect the company to return the best and most relevant results. PageRank only works if the \u201clink juice\u201d that is being passed from one site to the next is real.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown \u2014 and probably unknowable \u2014 how many expired sites are out there. But I find it pretty incredible that Google isn\u2019t cracking down harder. There are hundreds of \u201cexpired\u201d sites being sold, for thousands of dollars at any given time, so it\u2019s clear the black-hat SEO folks know something that Google doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201c[Short-term strategies are] referred to as churn-and-burn. That used to be a common thing, but you would hear more of this toward the earlier days of search engines. Doing all that is a lot of work; you can invest all that time, then do it again and do it again and do it again, or you can do it right from the beginning and not have to keep doing it,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cUsers want to find good content \u2014 that\u2019s why we publish our advice and say, \u2018These are the things to do if someone has got legitimate ideas and has a business they want to get started with and they want to be successful.\u2019 I would be concerned that they might look at something like this and think, \u2018Oh, I guess I should do that,\u2019 without realizing that this is not the long-term path that they should be following.\u201d\n\nIt may well be that expired domains aren\u2019t a legitimate method for building a long-term business, but Sullivan is onto something here. The folks who do this type of black-hat SEO simply don\u2019t care. Sure, perhaps this only works in the short term, but when the spammers are raking in the cash, maybe that\u2019s all they need.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for many years, and Google never grows wise to it,\u201d said Jeremy, a black-hat SEO expert who spoke to me at length for this article and asked to withhold his last name to secure anonymity. \u201cIt would be so easy for Google to look at the domains that are for sale and then blacklist them. Somehow, they never do, and so my business continues as it has done.\u201d\n\nThe cat-and-mouse game between Google and those seeking to manipulate the search results continues apace. If you come across a site that appears to be spam, there\u2019s a page you can use to report it. \u201cHopefully, you\u2019ll find it if you search for \u2018report spam to Google,\u2019\u201d Sullivan noted drily."}
