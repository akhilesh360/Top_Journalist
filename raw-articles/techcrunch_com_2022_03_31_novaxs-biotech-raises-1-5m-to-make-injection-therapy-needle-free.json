Chinese venture capital firm NewGen VC has also joined the round. AiBasis, an investment firm led by Baidu co-founder Lei Ming, and Boston-based Taihill Venture have expressed \u201cgreat interest\u201d but haven\u2019t invested, according to Su.\n\nNovaXS\u2019s injection gun, which patients can snuggly hold in their hand, can push biologics into the body\u2019s subcutaneous and intramuscular level within 0.3 seconds using liquid pressure. The device also comes with a cloud-based platform that collects patient information for physicians, like injection time, frequency, dosage volume, and medication temperature.\n\nThe startup has found two early use cases already \u2014 in vitro fertilization and drug delivery for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Su is particularly passionate about the treatment of the latter. DMD, an inherited disease caused by defects in a gene that encodes the protein critical to muscle functions, can put patients in wheelchairs by the age of 12. There is an existing FDA-approved solution that uses an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver modified genetic material to cells impacted, but the treatment can potentially generate adverse side effects.\n\nRecent advancement in gene-editing technology has given the once incurable disease new hope, though much needs to be done to actually turn the lab work into commercially viable solutions. That\u2019s what NovaXS aspires to do, with Su bringing her bioengineering professor Irina Conboy\u2019s gene-editing CRISPR therapies to DMD patients using the startup\u2019s needle-less injector.\n\n\u201cMany large pharmaceutical companies lack the incentive to fund IVF or rare disease R&D because these specific markets have limited patients. On the other hand, smaller companies are lacking the resources to tackle such daunting tasks,\u201d said Su.\n\nNovaXS is targeting gene therapy and IVF at the initial phase because Su believes they have \u201cthe biggest potential to acquire a large market share.\u201d It\u2019s also planning to work on other diseases that require in-home injections, such as diabetes and growth hormone disorders in children.\n\n\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The startup will still be headquartered in the US but conducting clinical trials for the DMD treatment in China, where local governments are luring foreign and returning science and technology talents with attractive money and policy support.\n\nUnlike in contested arenas like semiconductors and artificial intelligence, where tech transfers between the US and China are increasingly restricted, Su reckoned that in medicines and healthcare, the two superpowers are incentivized to collaborate because of a larger pool of clinical data is the basic staple of medical advancements.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our research to just get published in Nature. We want it to be helping people in real life,\u201d Su said.\n\nThe business prospects of cutting-edge and still evolving technology like gene editing therapies can be hard to predict, and the Theranos saga has only made venture capitalists more prudent about esoteric medicines. But Su saw a silver lining.\n\n\u201cThe problem of Theranos isn\u2019t its business but its science. We are not short of great scientists, but we don\u2019t have enough medical talent who also understands business. We hope to fill the gap.\u201d\n\nUpdate on April 5: NovaXS told TechCrunch earlier that the funding round has closed. The investment has not closed, and the company is still in discussion with AiBasis and Taihill. The article has been updated to reflect that."}
