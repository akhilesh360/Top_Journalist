This combined effect prevents virus-carrying droplets from traveling through the filter fibers, which, without the treatment, only prevent some viral transmission.\n\n\u201c \u2018Capture Coating\u2019 is designed to mitigate and significantly decrease viral transmission of COVID-19 through specified air filtration media by forming a breathable, flexible, non-leaching, water-repellent barrier against aqueous respiratory droplets that act as virion carriers that can potentially be recirculated through conventional air-filters,\u201d wrote Curran Biotech founder and University of Houston physics professor Shay Curran in an email. Despite the molecular complexity of the coating, the product itself can simply be sprayed onto an HVAC system\u2019s filter.\n\nThis new droplet-targeting coating is an improvement over current filtration methods, which typically only target dry molecules. Not only do those methods often have at least some potential of viral droplet transmission, but current solutions to improve them aren\u2019t always energy efficient.\n\n\u201cIn the world where energy management is very important, that means recycling the same air in the building with the risk of cross contamination,\u201d wrote Curran. \u201cTaking outside air is one way to dilute the air, but that means we also lose a huge amount in terms of energy, and still don\u2019t solve the problem of taking the virus away from places where people congregate.\u201d\n\nIndoor air ventilation remains an important tool in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 across schools, small businesses and other public buildings, but updating old HVAC systems to the recommended CDC standards can be costly. Curran hopes that his company\u2019s approach can help address this issue, as the Capture Coating requires only a simple spray, rather than a completely new system of filters. \u201cThat really means for a few dollars when used on a standard issue MERV8, you can have huge indoor protection and stop its spread throughout the building,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The hydrophobic qualities of the coating prevent respiratory droplets from actions like sneezing or coughing from passing through the filter, while the HVAC system itself retains its normal capabilities for dry molecule filtration. With the Capture Coating, common droplet-transmitting viruses like the flu or cold will also be filtered out of circulation.\n\nSimilarly, the nanocoating would work in preventing transmission of any variant of the COVID-19 virus, as all of those variants also undergo droplet transmission. \u201cIt does not mean we get away from taking precautions such as hand washing, wearing masks etc, but it does mean we can work indoors far more safely,\u201d wrote Curran.\n\nSo far, Curran Biotech\u2019s Capture Coating technology is in use in 11 states, and will soon be announcing partnerships with distributors and filter companies to directly provide consumers with coated filters. Curran wrote that the company has also had successful trials of the technology in New York City, and hopes to expand use of the product even further across businesses and institutions around the country.\n\nEarly Stage is the premier \u201chow-to\u201d event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.
