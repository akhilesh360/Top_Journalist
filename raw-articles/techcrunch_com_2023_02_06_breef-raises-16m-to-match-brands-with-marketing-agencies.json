The new capital brings Breef\u2019s total raised to $21 million, which co-founder and CEO George Raptis says will be put toward continuing to develop the company\u2019s product and growing the size of Breef\u2019s workforce from 30 people to roughly 60 by 2024.\n\n\u201cBreef\u2019s latest funding will be used to continue to evolve the product offering \u2014 a new \u2018from the ground up\u2019 platform is being launched with the funding announcement \u2014 and grow its global team, announcing its first international bases in the U.K. and Australia,\u201d Raptis told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThe company will also invest further in its payment infrastructure, allowing structured payments for brands looking to \u2018grow now, pay later.\u2019\u201d\n\nBreef was co-founded in 2019 by Emily Bibb and Raptis. Bibb previously worked in marketing and in-house ad agencies as well as startups such as PopSugar and VSCO. Meanwhile, Raptis helped to launch Credible.com, the online loan marketplace that was acquired by Fox in 2019.\n\nBoth Bibb and Raptis attribute their wanting to start Breef to a shift in the way of agency work. Full-time hires and the \u201cbig agency\u201d model were no longer flexible \u2014 or affordable \u2014 enough to service the demands of today\u2019s brands, they felt, while the challenges around outsourcing were steeply increasing.\n\n\u201cThe agency space has traditionally been a relationship-first business. The nature of work is long, with brands embarking on a search process spanning months despite inaccurate \u2018scopes of work\u2019 and often no guidance \u2014 hence the emergence of the \u2019boutique agency,\u2019\u201d Raptis said. \u201cBut the technology had not been created to vet and centralize agencies and give brands confidence throughout the search \u2026 In short, if someone could centralize agencies and help brands move faster, then \u2018the old way\u2019 of working with agencies was ready to be replaced.\u201d\n\nBreef, Raptis claims, achieves this by offering a way to kick off agency search, contracting and payments in one place. An \u201cagency marketplace,\u201d Breef lets brands plan, scope and post projects for digital marketing, social media, PR campaigns, web and app development and branding to get pitches from agencies on the platform. Brands can select a team and kick off projects, managing contracts and payments from a dedicated dashboard.\n\nRaptis claims that more than 10,000 agencies and thousands of brands are on Breef, with turnaround times for pitches ranging from a couple of days to around a week.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Toward the end of 2022, the company achieved a major milestone \u2014 $100 million in projects created on the platform \u2014 and inked partnerships with spend automation platform Ramp, venue rental marketplace Peerspace and business marketplace Newity.\n\nRaptis wouldn\u2019t answer questions about Breef\u2019s revenue, save that the company grew \u201c10x\u201d last year \u2014 a vague figure to be sure. But he expressed confidence in the startup\u2019s growth trajectory, despite competition from startups like BizBulwark (which offers a similar marketing marketplace) and Agency Spotter (an ad agency search tool).\n\n\u201cFor marketers, Breef means ease of planning, scoping and outsourcing \u2014 at the speed modern brands require. And more importantly, access to diverse talent, with innovative ideas,\u201d Raptis said. \u201cFor CFOs, it means centralization of marketing spend through market transparency, payment flexibility and contract standardization. For the creative and boutique agencies, it means the opportunity to work with leading brands without needing an internal sales team. It also means safety and transparency around payments and contracts.\u201d\n\nGreycroft investor Ali Schleider \u2014 not the most unbiased source, granted \u2014 agreed.\n\n\u201cThe amount of demand we are seeing from brands and agencies flowing through the platform shows companies are looking for a new way to get creative work done,\u201d she said. \u201cOur belief is that Breef is not only repositioning marketing spend, but creating an accessible solution for quality talent \u2014 no matter market conditions.\u201d"}
