Acurable is a medical device company that makes patient-friendly wearable devices that accurately diagnose and manage respiratory conditions at home. As a career-long academic, Rodriguez-Villegas never intended to be a founder until she learned about how the currently available medical devices made it extremely difficult to detect and treat diseases like sleep apnea and epilepsy. On this episode we talk about balancing academic research and running a company, how to scale a medical device startup and how Acurable has spread to hospitals throughout the U.K. by just word of mouth.\n\nSubscribe to Found to hear more stories from founders each week.\n\nConnect with us:"}
