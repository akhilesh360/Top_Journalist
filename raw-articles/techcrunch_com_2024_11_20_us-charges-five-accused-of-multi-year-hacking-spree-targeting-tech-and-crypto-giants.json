The hackers also allegedly used SIM swapping attacks to steal employees\u2019 phone numbers and get their passwords by using password reset features.\n\nVictims mentioned in the court documents published on Wednesday include U.S. based organizations providing entertainment products, virtual currency, cloud communication platforms, and telecommunication services. The hackers allegedly stole $6.3 million in cryptocurrency from a single unnamed victim, the indictment says.\n\n\u201cWe allege that this group of cybercriminals perpetrated a sophisticated scheme to steal intellectual property and proprietary information worth tens of millions of dollars and steal personal information belonging to hundreds of thousands of individuals,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada, as quoted in the press release.\n\nAs part of the announcement, the DOJ unsealed three court documents related to the case.\n\nSecurity researchers have previously linked the alleged hackers to a prolific hacking group called 0ktapus, for their use of spoofing Okta login portals used by tech giants. The hackers targeted hundreds of companies over a months-long hacking campaign in 2022, including Twilio, Coinbase, and DoorDash, and again in 2023 to target game makers, including Riot Games.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the DOJ, confirmed to TechCrunch that the five hackers are suspected of being part of the group known as Scattered Spider.\n\nIn one of the court documents, prosecutors describe the cybercriminal gang as \u201ca loosely organized financially motivated cybercriminal group whose members primarily target large companies and their contracted telecommunications, information technology, and business process outsourcing suppliers.\u201d\n\nAccording to one of the court documents, which cites the FBI\u2019s investigation, Buchanan and the other hackers targeted at least 45 companies in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and other countries.\n\nUrban is accused of having stolen more than $800,000 in Bitcoin and Ethereum from several victims, one of the court documents says. One of the documents also mentions an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator,\u201d and \u201cother co-conspirators,\u201d suggesting there\u2019s more suspects that have yet to be publicly accused of crimes.\n\nThe hackers are said to be part of a wider cybercriminal community referred to by researchers as \u201cthe Com,\u201d a largely nebulous network of mostly young adults and teenagers, who are highly proficient in impersonation and social engineering techniques capable of tricking employees into handing over their corporate passwords.\n\nEvans is accused of writing software used for phishing attacks, as well as managing online infrastructure, such as a Telegram channel, to exchange stolen credentials and virtual currency. Authorities found files that contained stolen credentials at the residence of Elbadawy in March 2023. In the case of several of the victims mentioned in the court documents, the hackers allegedly used fake websites of Okta, a popular secure authentication provider.\n\nThe National Crime Agency did not respond to a request for comment on Buchanan\u2019s arrest.\n\nCarly Page contributed reporting."}
