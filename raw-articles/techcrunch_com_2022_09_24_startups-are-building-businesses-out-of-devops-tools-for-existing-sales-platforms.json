It\u2019s become a blossoming sector all its own, with vendors selling DevOps platforms for software including Salesforce purporting to make sales tech easier to integrate into a company\u2019s existing workflows.\n\nBut wait, you might say: Wasn\u2019t the promise of sales software to minimize the need for custom coding to accomplish sales-related tasks? Well, yes \u2014 up to a point.\n\nTake Salesforce, for example. Built to be a customer relationship management platform, it evolved over time into a development platform \u2014 but without many of the components required to adapt it to organizations\u2019 particular needs.\n\n\u201cSalesforce has been dabbling in the DevOps space but hasn\u2019t really committed,\u201d Elodie Dupuy, the founder and managing partner at Full In Partners, told TechCrunch in an email interview. Full In Partners is an investor in AutoRabit, which provides CI/CD tools for Salesforce customer dev teams. \u201cThey rolled out the Salesforce Developer Experience in 2017 and the beta version of the Salesforce DevOps Center earlier this summer, but the solutions are incomplete for enterprise companies who are essentially running application development on the Salesforce platform.\u201d\n\nAnother investor in the sales platform DevOps space, Sri Rao, sees tools in the vein of AutoRabit taking pressure off of developers tasked with building internal software products. Rao is a general partner at Silversmith, which recently led in a funding round for Salesforce dev tooling startup Gearset.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

At the same time, while developers are an increasingly important persona, they must also continue to focus on building products for their core front office personas in sales, service, marketing and commerce.\u201d\n\nRao continued: \u201cSimilar to traditional software development, \u2018DevOps for X\u2019 is needed to manage the proliferation of users contributing code and making changes [to platforms like Salesforce,]. Third-party tools help to bring order to the process and ensure deployments are successful and without the kinds of errors that can bring the rest of the system down.\u201d\n\nThe accelerating pace of development is helping to drive the adoption of these tools, as well, according to Gartner research director Thomas Murphy. He pointed to surveys like a 2020 report from OverOps, a provider of software analytics tools, which found that nearly half of developers (45%) felt \u201cpressure to move fast was one of their top software quality challenges,\u201d while more than half (59%) were expected to release code and features anywhere from biweekly to multiple times a day.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that you bought software, spent a lot of time and money configuring, integrating and customizing a set of software, and then it would be updated by the vendor infrequently,\u201d Murphy told TechCrunch via email. \u201cHowever, vendors have faster and more frequent release cycles and customers have more frequent needs to make changes to business processes, deploy new functionality and more. This places the same pressure on the team to keep up and automate things just like we have seen with standard software development.\u201d\n\nMurphy said that AutoRabit, Gearset and similar startups have simply recognized that there\u2019s a market opportunity that general-purpose DevOps tools like GitHub or CloudBees don\u2019t address. Rather than trying to compete where there are established players, these \u201cDevOps for X\u201d vendors are creating something focused on a specific product and platform, he said \u2014 and on users who don\u2019t come from the same type of technical background.\n\n\u201cMaking this approachable means you have a stronger chance to succeed in your market,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cI do think the market will go through evolutions, that we are quite early in the process, and that there is a great opportunity. This opportunity will also impact implementation partners as they will need to shift to more automated processes as well as aid clients in implementing these types of platforms.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the risk that the Salesforces of the world build their own tooling to replace third-party solutions. But Murphy notes they haven\u2019t historically been strong at doing this, preferring instead to acquire partners if they feel there\u2019s a market or cash flow advantage (see: Heroku).\n\nWhere it concerns Salesforce specifically, Dupuy and Rao point to the company\u2019s investments in supporting tech partners through efforts like AppExchange, Salesforce\u2019s apps and extensions marketplace, as evidence Salesforce isn\u2019t looking to build its own more robust set of DevOps tools.\n\n\u201cSalesforce [knows] they can\u2019t solve all their customers\u2019 problems in a closed ecosystem, similar to why Apple or Google don\u2019t try to build everything in their respective App Stores,\u201d Dupuy said. \u201cThe role for integrated service partners partners to enhance Salesforce-native capabilities isn\u2019t going away, as you can see with AutoRabit and multibillion-dollar companies in the Salesforce space like Conga, Veeva and nCino.\u201d\n\nAs for what the future holds, Rao anticipates purpose-built DevOps startups expanding far beyond sales platforms. It\u2019s already begun, with companies like Xtype building \u2014 and raising capital for \u2014 DevOps services around ServiceNow.\n\nMurphy, too, sees tailor-made DevOps tools evolving. But he argues they\u2019ll go in the direction of predictive analytics and automation, following the lead of the rest of the DevOps market.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly an appetite for it. According to one source, 65% of enterprises increased their analytics spending in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of a sequence \u2014 find a bottleneck and automate it, put the discrete automations together to drive more efficiency, then move from automation to measurement and predictive analytics,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe market will move into, \u2018Can these tools help me understand value attainment, opportunities to reduce spend and keep me in regulatory compliance?\u2019\u201d\n\nDupuy, focused on the nearer term, argued that DevOps for Salesforce solutions will grow in appeal to executives as new Salesforce developers enter the workforce.\n\n\u201cThese new developers will need guardrails to help them navigate a development process that\u2019s overly complex without the right toolset,\u201d she said. \u201cThe role of the Salesforce admin and developer will continue to merge as the concept of low-code and no-code development on the Salesforce platform takes hold. These admins and developers will need tools that support them across the entire Salesforce management process, whether that\u2019s in service of promoting clean, safe code or managing Salesforce users and workflows.\u201d"}
