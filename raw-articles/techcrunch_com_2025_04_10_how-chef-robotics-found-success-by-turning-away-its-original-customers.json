But friends and investors encouraged him, so he persevered.\n\nToday, Chef Robotics has not only survived, it\u2019s one of the few food tech robotic companies that is thriving. The startup, which recently raised a $20.6 million Series A, has 40 employees and marquee customers like Amy\u2019s Kitchen and Chef Bombay. Dozens of robots installed across the U.S. have made 45 million meals to date, Bhageria says.\n\nThis compares to a graveyard of failed food tech robotics companies, including Chowbotics with its salad-making robot Sally; pizza delivery robot Zume; food kiosk robot Karakuri, and, more recently, agtech Small Robot Company.\n\nBhageria says he saved his company by doing something that early-stage founders fear to do: turning away signed customers and millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nThe grasping problem\n\nIt all began when Bhageria did his master\u2019s degree in robotics at UPenn\u2019s famed GRASP Lab. He dreamed of the sci-fi promised world where robots did our housework, mowed our lawns, and cooked us five-star dinners.\n\nSuch a world doesn\u2019t exist yet because engineers have yet to fully solve the robotic grasping problem. Training the same robot to wash a wine glass without crushing it and a cast iron pan without dropping it is a difficult task.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That\u2019s an enormous industry with a chronic employee shortage.\n\n\u201cWe actually had signed contracts. Like we had multimillion-dollar signed contracts. Obviously, we\u2019re not doing this anymore. So what happened?\u201d he said. \u201cWe essentially could not solve the technical problem.\u201d\n\nIn those types of businesses, an employee completes an order by assembling all the varied ingredients necessary for each meal. These restaurants want robots to replicate that process because the alternative is to have dozens of robots dedicated to, and calibrated for, a single ingredient, some of which may only be used occasionally (we\u2019re looking at you, anchovies).\n\nBut Bhageria and team couldn\u2019t build a successful pick-up-anything robot because the training data doesn\u2019t exist. He asked his potential customers to let him install robots for one or two ingredients, gathering training data and building from there. They said no.\n\nThen Bhageria had an epiphany.\n\nInstead of going bust trying to give existing customers what they wanted, maybe he needed different customers. \u201cIt honestly sucked, because I spent the last year and a half of my life trying to convince these people, these fast casual companies, to work up with us,\u201d he recalled.\n\nChef Robotics founder Rajat Bhageria Image Credits:Chef Robotics\n\nSaying no leads to yes\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that fundraising after 2021 was brutal. VCs were also looking at the graveyard. \u201cWe talked to dozens of different funds,\u201d Bhageria said. \u201cWe just got rejected over and over.\u201d\n\nBhageria was thinking of giving up. \u201cYou come home and are like, what am I doing in my life? Am I doing the wrong thing? Should I quit?\u201d he remembered.\n\nBut he dug in and in March, 2023, raised an $11.2 million seed round led by Construct Capital, while also landing checks from Promus Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, and Gaingels.\n\nBhageria and team also found their perfect market, a part of the food industry known as \u201chigh mix manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThese are food makers that have many, many recipes, and make thousands of servings, but typically as meals or meal trays. For instance; salads and sandwiches or main courses and side dishes. These are meals used by airlines and hospitals, etc., or are frozen food meals for consumers.\n\nRather than one employee grabbing all the ingredients for each meal, \u201chigh mix\u201d employees form an assembly line. Each person adds their individual ingredient to the tray repeatedly until the order is complete. Then they assemble the next recipe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually hundreds of humans who are standing in a 34 Fahrenheit room, and they\u2019re essentially scooping food for eight hours a day,\u201d he describes. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a terrible job.\u201d\n\nConsequently, this industry has chronic labor shortages as well.\n\nRobotics wasn\u2019t economically feasible for them in the past because of the variety of ingredients involved. But a startup building a flexible-ingredient bot, where the robots are built in partnership with the food maker, works.\n\nBetter still, \u201cas we learn how to do this chorizo, or we learn peas, or this sauce, or these zucchinis,\u201d the bots get the real-world training data they need to eventually serve fast-casual restaurants. Bhageria says this is still on his roadmap.\n\nBest of all, thanks to VC\u2019s reborn interest in all things AI, fundraising this time was \u201cweirdly\u201d easy, Bhageria says.\n\nAvataar Venture Partners, co-founded by former Norwest VC Mohan Kumar, was specifically looking to fund \u201cAI in the physical world\u201d startups and actually pursued Chef Robotics, Bhageria says. He closed this round in less than a month. Avataar led, with existing investors Construct Capital, Bloomberg Beta, and Promus Ventures piling in, among others.\n\nThe new funding brings Chef\u2019s total raised to $38.8 million. He also signed a new $22.5 million loan from Silicon Valley Bank for equipment financing, bringing Chef\u2019s total debt raised to $26.76 million.\n\nAnd the process this time was \u201cexhilarating,\u201d he said.\n\nNote: This story was updated to reflect updated equity and debt totals."}
