Then there are the Seekers, the people who might type their specific query into Google Search and tack \u201cReddit\u201d on the end so they can find real advice and opinions from real people.\n\nReddit Answers, the company\u2019s AI-powered chatbot that surfaces verbatim answers and summaries from existing Reddit posts, is for the Seekers. And early results suggest it is already gaining traction.\n\n\u201cUp until very recently, we haven\u2019t built a product for them,\u201d Huffman said Thursday on the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call. \u201cThose users are not coming to Reddit for a community in that moment. They\u2019re coming for an answer. And I think we can [acknowledge] the use case that the user\u2019s bringing us and be more effective at solving it.\u201d\n\nReddit announced during the call that its Answers product already has 1 million weekly active users since it launched in beta in December. Last month, Reddit expanded Answers beyond the U.S. and into Australia, the U.K., Canada, and India.\n\nThe feature, which is still in beta, currently lives in the navigation bar of the app as its own separate experience. Going into 2025, Reddit plans to integrate Answers more deeply into the platform in a few different ways.\n\nHuffman said the most obvious way to do this would be to integrate Answers into the primary search box, which could allow users to type in a full query rather than just a few keywords.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, a Google Search algorithm change caused some \u201cvolatility\u201d with Reddit\u2019s user growth, which spooked investors at the time, despite beating earnings estimates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an open platform, and we want people to find Reddit content in [Google] Search,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cBeing open drives awareness and visibility. It can also create variability, and we do expect some bumps along the way from Google, because we\u2019ve already seen a few this year. This is expected in any year, but given that the Search ecosystem is under heavy construction, the near term could be more bumpy than usual.\u201d\n\nReddit\u2019s stock soared in after-hours trading as the company beat analyst earnings expectations and strong user growth. The company reported revenue of $392.4 million, up 61% year-over-year, an adjusted EBITDA of $115.3 million, and daily active unique users of 108.1 million, a 31% YoY increase.\n\nIn the second quarter, Reddit estimates revenue in the range of $410 million to $430 million and adjusted EBITDA between $110 million and $130 million."}
