They know all the reasons why you can never do something in that area. It takes a beginner\u2019s mind, almost a little naivety, to have real insight in some areas.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s often seen as an advantage to have experience in the industry you\u2019re trying to solve for, or sell to, that experience must be paired with the insight to see a solution.\n\nMaqubela said Wessler\u2019s optimism about addressing cardiovascular health in a new way, paired with his deep understanding of the existing landscape, was attractive: \u201cWhat I liked about Jeff was that he was from that world, but he was not of that world,\u201d said Maqubela.\n\nHe added that Kindred is more than willing to invest in founders before they have a product or even a prototype, but that there is certain criteria involved. Alongside domain insight, Kindred also looks for personality that people want to partner with. As part of the firm\u2019s investment due diligence in Wessler, Kindred helped recruit technical co-founding partners.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The slide described cardiovascular disease as a bigger threat than all cancers combined, but is 80% preventable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest health issue facing America and has humongous impact,\u201d said Maqubela. \u201cEveryone I\u2019ve spoken to since day one of Heartbeat Health, either in a pitch capacity or a recruitment capacity or from our team, has experience with heart disease, with friends or family or loved ones in one way or another. It\u2019s a problem that gripped you.\u201d\n\nOne of the key factors any good venture investor looks for is the size of the market. When you realize that everyone you\u2019ve spoken with is in some way affected by heart disease, it becomes evident that the market is absolutely massive. Heartbeat Health benefited from the fact that heart disease is both an emotional burden for almost everyone, and also \u2018an incredibly valuable business problem to solve.\u2019\n\nAt the early stage, TAM is often evaluated alongside business model. Though Heartbeat Health\u2019s model has changed significantly since then \u2014 from D2C to B2B2C \u2014 it still resonated with Kindred.\n\nHeartbeat Health Pitch Deck by Jordan Crook on Scribd\n\n\u201cWhen I look at a business model, I\u2019m looking for heuristics \u2014 that the things you\u2019re going to be able to do on the basis of the team and your product are going to translate closely enough into large amounts of money,\u201d said Maqubela, as he literally waved his hand in the air.\n\n\u201cClose enough is literally hand-wavy, at this stage, because you just don\u2019t know and you\u2019re going to have to figure it out. What I looked at when I saw this was \u2018How many patients a month?\u2019 and \u2018How much money per patient?\u2019 and \u2018How many people have heart disease?\u2019 and \u2018How hard is it going to be to do this?\u2019 \u2026 Well, suddenly I\u2019m getting the big numbers.\u201d\n\nThe pivot\n\nVenturing away from the deck for a moment, Wessler and Maqubela started to explain the decision to pivot the model from D2C to B2B2C.\n\nWessler had this to say:\n\nWe were building a model around people who wanted to try the new fancy thing, but didn\u2019t really need us at that time, and so we weren\u2019t really making significant changes in their long-term outcomes. So we had a pretty hard decision as a company to take this from a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019 to a \u2018need-to-have\u2019 for the whole country, and ultimately the world. If we\u2019re going to do that, then we have to show that Heartbeat can influence these expensive, incredibly dangerous outcomes of heart disease, and that we can reduce the number of heart issues and events that are happening. To do that, we had to get into the payor world. The payor 101 primer for healthcare is: it\u2019s incredibly hard to break into. In order to do it, you have to invest a lot in proving outcomes and demonstrating that the model, whatever it is, is going to lower the costs of disease state and improve the outcomes with no sacrifice in quality or at a better quality. And that takes years to show. So we ultimately sat down and decided that this is the way we\u2019re going to get to this long-term vision. We\u2019ve got to invest years in it. It\u2019s not going to happen over six months. And we made the decision to lean hard into that.\n\nNow, Heartbeat Health focuses on helping cardiologists and clinicians acquire customers well before they get sick. Between the pre-seed and the Series A, Maqubela realized that there are entire industries, particularly in digital health, where distribution is not a separate part of the business, but rather the product itself.\n\nHe explained that heart health itself isn\u2019t a difficult problem to solve. If you check your blood pressure early, eat and sleep well, stop smoking, and maybe take relevant medicines, you\u2019re probably going to be better off.\n\n\u201cBut how do you get those things to people when they need them?\u201d he mused. \u201cHow do you get those things to people early enough? Actually, distribution is the rub. Distribution isn\u2019t just a tactic that you use to sell your products. Distribution is the product.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding that distribution was the core problem to solve shifted the way Heartbeat Health did business. The company decided to build a suite of distribution pathways and optimized those pathways, understanding that those channels are as core to the product offering as anything else.\n\nBuild it\n\nAs we returned to the deck, Maqubela highlighted a slide that I would have never expected him to select.\n\nThe slide showed a picture of a landing page. But Maqubela said that seeing that landing page, and noting that it had a real phone number on it, told him something critical: you\u2019re able to build a website. At a very basic level, Maqubela is looking for someone who is willing to take the time and energy to learn to build something.\n\n\u201cOne of the things at the seed stage that I\u2019m trying to evaluate is\u2026 for every person who can create a deck, you divide that by x to find the number of people who can create a deck and also build the things in that deck,\u201d said Maqubela.\n\nBut a website is far from the only thing that Wessler was building.\n\nEarly on, Heartbeat had decided to have its own physical footprint in the world: a clinic where it would have its own doctors using its own technology and products to serve patients. Wessler said it was the worst early decision and best long-term decision that the team made. Worst because it took up all of the team\u2019s energy and attention, not only because it is resource-consuming to build a practice, but also because of the responsibility that comes with seeing and caring for patients that is separate from the responsibility of building a tech company.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, it gave us a real testing ground for patients and clinicians to see what works with patients, what services can and can\u2019t be delivered virtually, and how we go about testing our hypotheses in real time,\u201d said Wessler.\n\n\u201cNow, a couple of years later, I think that practice gave us a huge leg up, because we\u2019re not building in a vacuum. We sell our products to someone else and because of that practice, we\u2019ve already figured out what works and achieved some degree of product-market fit internally. We have data to back up what works and show our successes.\u201d\n\nI asked Maqubela about the decision to build a practice alongside the tech company, and how he evaluates founders that insist on a physical footprint as part of their business.\n\n\u201cThe best founders don\u2019t ever conduct an experiment without a very clear point of view for what they\u2019re trying to prove, and how, based on the evidence, what they\u2019re going to do next,\u201d said Maqubela. \u201cIf you want to do brick-and-mortar for psychiatric services because \u2018insert hypothesis here,\u2019 and if that hypothesis is really interesting and can be proven in some way, then go put down some brick and go put down some mortar.\u201d\n\nYou can check out the full conversation with Wessler and Maqubela below, including their feedback to our TechCrunch Live Pitch-off companies."}
