It sells a camera. That clips onto the side of a toilet bowl. It takes pictures of your poop. Currently in beta, the system utilizes artificial intelligence to examine your dookie as a way of determining things like gut health and hydration.\n\nTurns out we have a surprising amount to learn from our logs.\n\nThrone calls its underlying technology \u201cartificial gut intelligence.\u201d That AI is \u201ctrained by physicians to help you understand what your waste is trying to tell you about your health,\u201d per the company. The doctors are looking for various signs of health found in waste matter, including \u201cnuances\u201d in urine to determine hydration levels.\n\nThe company is quick to note that the images are \u201canonymized.\u201d TechCrunch reached out to the company to get a better idea of what Throne is doing to address the inevitable security and privacy red flags that arise when discussing a toilet camera.\n\nImage Credits:Throne\n\nAt TechCrunch\u2019s behest, the firm on Friday posted a \u201cprivacy and security\u201d page outlining some of those measures. At the top of that list, no doubt, are the joint questions of what, precisely, Throne is recording and how it uses those images. The camera is mercifully trained down at the bowl.\n\n\u201cWe only capture images of the contents of your toilet bowl,\u201d Throne writes. \u201cAny other data is irrelevant to our mission and could compromise our ability to provide accurate health insights. We use image recognition technology to automatically delete any non-relevant images. This ensures that only toilet-related data is retained.\u201d\n\nUsers can request full access to their data to see what manner of crap Throne is collecting. The company will also delete everything upon request. All data is encrypted by TLS 1.2 or higher on the company\u2019s servers.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That much can be said about Throne\u2019s founders. CEO Scott Hickle tells TechCrunch that the startup began life as a marketplace for healthcare staffing, only to realize almost immediately that it had entered an already overcrowded field.\n\nImage Credits:Throne\n\nShortly after raising an initial $1.2 million from investors, including Night Capital, Rief Ventures, and Hustle Fund, the company found itself at a crossroads.\n\n\u201cWithin six weeks we came to the painful realization that the market was saturated and not a sandbox we wanted to play in,\u201d says Hickle, \u201cso we pivoted, and our investors were shockingly cool with us tackling consumer hardware.\u201d\n\nThrone didn\u2019t just pivot. It pivoted to poop. The company is focused on both the aging population and those with chronic digestive conditions, including Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, and IBS.\n\nIf that sounds like you \u2014 and you\u2019re able to get past the idea of mounting a camera to your toilet \u2014 Throne\u2019s system is up for preorder following a limited beta. The going price for a smart toilet camera is $499, though the company is making it available for $299 if you want to get in on it early."}
