Farmers use the app to chronicle the progress of their transition, e.g. by taking photos of crop growth, as a way of proving they\u2019re sticking with the program (Klim also uses satellite data for monitoring and says it also undertakes some site visits); and \u2014 if they do that \u2014 they can earn revenue payouts for carbon sequestered as their farm\u2019s soil health improves, over the years, or as they undertake other environmentally focused interventions (such as restoring hedges, reforesting or planting flower strips to boost biodiversity).\n\nThe startup does not currently offer loans to farmers via its platform but it says it\u2019s looking into it \u2014 likely in conjunction with agricultural banks, where the interest rate could be linked to their climate performance as an added incentive \u2014 saying it may expand to providing farmers with financial support to get going with regenerative methods too. (\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different angles and tools where you can help farmers make a better living if they are doing something that\u2019s better for the planet,\u201d it suggests, emphasizing: \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. You want to set the incentives so that sustainable agriculture makes more sense than unsustainable agriculture \u2014 and that\u2019s the challenge we\u2019re all working on.)\n\nWhile Klim talks keenly of being on an environmental \u201cmission\u201d, it is a for-profit venture \u2014 so it\u2019s also intending to monetize as it supports farmers to earn money for cultivating carbon sinks on their land.\n\nEcosystem services marketplace\n\nIts business model involves taking a commission on the sale of carbon \u2018insets\u2019 (as opposed to offsets; the idea being they will be sold to entities to shrink emissions within their own supply chains) \u2014 creating a marketplace where farmers can sell what it bills as \u201cecosystem services\u201d, meaning they can generate revenue off of practices that suck up more CO2 than if they\u2019d continued farming without adopting a regenerative approach.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

So the upshot is a farmer following the program gets paid for \u2018farming carbon\u2019, as it\u2019s sometimes called \u2014 in addition to selling any actual crops/food they produce \u2014 and Klim gets its cut of any sequestered carbon or other \u2018eco services\u2019 they sell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all an investment into the future,\u201d says CEO and co-founder Dr Robert Gerlach. \u201cWe help the farmer to do that with a digital platform that gives the farmer a way to transition, it gives them the know-how to do it, and it gives them farm management tools to achieve that.\u201d\n\nThe startup\u2019s work doesn\u2019t stop there. It\u2019s also seeking to support farmers to transition to less environmentally damaging methods by working with food companies and retailers to raise their profile with consumers \u2014 with an eye on the extra value that might be squeezed out (i.e. via a higher price) for produce that can claim to have taken less of an toll on the planet prior to arriving on the plate vs conventionally farmed alternatives.\n\n\u201cWe position the farmer in public with the consumer as a climate hero,\u201d Gerlach tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe work with industry \u2014 especially the food industry \u2014 [which] needs to transform its supply chain. They need to reduce the emissions in their supply chain and they need to secure the yields in their supply chain even though there\u2019s ever more frequent droughts.\n\n\u201cThe only way they can achieve that is if they transition their supply chain to regenerative. But the food industry does not really have access, in some cases, to their own farmers \u2014 for example in the case of retail \u2014 or they do really know how to best actually transition their farmers and we then come in with our platform and help them to transition their farmers to regenerative agriculture.\u201d\n\nThis includes a \u201cKlim label\u201d that can be put on food packaging \u2014 using a QR code to point consumers to information showcasing the farmer and their regenerative methods. \u201cI can tell you that farmers love that consumers are learning about regenerative agriculture,\u201d says Gerlach. \u201cIf a consumer appreciates that a farmer works in a climate-friendly way he\u2019s probably also willing to pay more for that \u2014 and that gives farmers security that they can actually embark on the journey to transition because consumers will reward it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarmers are in some form of crisis of meaning,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey see that their profitability is dropping over the last decades, they see that the regulatory requirements are rising and they see that in public they are often unjustly portrayed as climate sinners \u2014 and what they really want is to gain a sense of purpose in what they do; they want to feel that what they\u2019re doing makes sense and is appreciated, especially by the consumer.\u201d\n\nSeed funding\n\nThe August 2020-founded startup has just closed a \u20ac6.5 million seed raise, led by Berlin-based food and green tech investor, Green Generation Fund to plough into further product dev and international expansion, as it races to get more farmers farming greener. Other investors in the round include biodiversity-focused fund Edaphon, early stage climate-focused VC Ponderosa and Silicon Valley-based agriculture foodtech and agtech fund Agfunder, with existing investors such as Ananda, FoodLabs and Wi Venture also joining the round.\n\nIn total, Klim has raised just shy of \u20ac8M since being founded \u2014 just two years ago. The latest cash injection is being put towards accelerating its mission to get as many farmers as possible tilling less, and sowing more, as quickly as possible. So while its early focus has been on its home turf it\u2019s now shooting for internationalization.\n\nWhich markets it\u2019ll be expanding into first are tbc but as it widens its net it will be going up against a broader crop of agriTech startups offering similar support for farmers to transform their methods \u2014 such as the likes of Danish startup Agreena; Regrow in the US; and veteran giant Indigo Agriculture, which has increased its focus on regenerative agriculture in recent years, to name three.\n\n\u201cOur mission and purpose is to get as many farmers to adopt regenerative practices or \u2018carbon farming\u2019 as fast as possible,\u201d emphasizes Gerlach. \u201cOnly if we can get many farmers to transition a lot of their farmland to regenerative agriculture do we have a chance to achieve the 1.5 degree temperature targets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a clear chance, we have as a planet, to achieve the 1.5 degree targets,\u201d he also argues. \u201cHowever it requires rapid action \u2014 and that\u2019s the whole point for Klim.\u201d\n\nBut what is regenerative agriculture?\n\nA few things to note upfront here: There is no fixed definition for \u2018regenerative agriculture\u2019 \u2014 hence it can refer to a different bundle of techniques in different regions (in the US it\u2019s often talked about in association with cattle farming, for example, which means it can have a chequered reputation among environmentalists). Moreover, in recent years, hype about claimed environmental benefits from making tweaks to existing agricultural processes has seen the buzzy badge of \u2018regenerative\u2019 keenly taken up by some of the biggest names in (junk) food production, from PepsiCo to McDonalds.\n\nSome of this hype has \u2014 frankly \u2014 been unbelievable. Such as an unsubstantiated claim that if all the planet\u2019s farmers switched to regenerative agriculture it could 100% reverse climate change. But while there\u2019s a healthy dose of scepticism around what looks like very lurid greenwashing by certain vested interests (most notably those with an agenda to claim you can \u2018green\u2019 unsustainable livestock farming); there are more measured and/or pragmatic proponents \u2014 and plenty of soil scientists \u2014 who argue there is worthwhile substance here.\n\nThese more measured supporters argue that by applying regenerative agriculture methods broadly it can help restore soil health and improve biodiversity in a meaningful, impactful way \u2014 across millions (or well billions if you\u2019re taking all farmed land on the planet) of hectares while still producing enough food to feed everyone in the world.\n\nThe claimed \u2018regenerative\u2019 transformation is done through the use of various soil-friendly (or, well, friendlier) methods \u2014 such as crop rotation and cover cropping, plus a reduction in mechanical tilling, along with promoting other beneficial activities like hedge restoration, reforesting etc \u2014 which, in turn, can allow farmers to avoid the conventionally heavy use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides; chemicals that are absolutely bad for biodiversity (and probably human health too) and more broadly damaging to the environment and the long term security of food production as they denude the health of the top soil, killing off the organic matter (humus) that\u2019s good at retaining water and taking up carbon.\n\nImpoverished soils are a direct problem for farmers, of course, as they reduce the quality (and potentially the yield) of food that can be produced from land \u2014 as well as exacerbating the impact of climate-associated issues like droughts that can devastate crops (since poor soils dry out faster). So there\u2019s a clear logic and interconnected web of potential benefits to be derived from adopting methods that can reduce some of the harms of conventional farming.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of modern agriculture we have released around 500 Gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. And, for example, in Germany right now each hectare (100m x 100m) of farmland releases 0.7 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere through the destruction of [organic matter in soils]. So we need to get farmers to convert quickly and if you want them to convert quickly you need to understand what is preventing them from converting in the first place. And that was our starting point,\u201d Gerlach explains.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important is to know that we have reduced soil carbon over the last 100 years \u2014 globally, some studies say that we have lost 50% of soil carbon. If you look at some color-coded maps that show you where we have lost soil carbon and how much it looks pretty damn bad. Very red. So in order to build that up again you need decades \u2014 so you need to start now. And the more regenerative methods you use, the more confidence a farmer gains in using these methods, the more soil carbon you can actually build up.\u201d\n\nAll that said, whether regenerative agriculture is \u2014 overall \u2014 net helpful or harmful for humanity when you consider the existential crisis of climate change facing all life on the planet and agriculture\u2019s leading contributory role in fuelling the crisis through the release of greenhouse gases is a wider question. The answer is probably closest to \u2018it depends\u2019.\n\nThing is, if the buzzy term ends up greenwashing agriculture\u2019s reputation to the extent that it acts as a barrier to the kind of wholesale transformation of global food production that\u2019s needed to avoid catastrophic climate change \u2014 say by creating an excuse for food giants to continue industrial-scale livestock farming, rather than switching to deriving their products from low-carbon, plant-based (and/or other alternative) proteins (at least some of which are already being produced in abundance) \u2014 there\u2019s an argument that the trend could end up doing more harm than good.\n\nBut, at the same time, we do face multiple sustainability crises in parallel. And the long term viability of agricultural food production is very evidently one of them \u2014 with no shortage of warnings that farmland simply won\u2019t continue to produce if we continue to treat soils so poorly. So soil restoration looks like vital, necessary work in and of itself. Measures to stem biodiversity loss are also essential.\n\nAdditionally, if you take it as given that humanity won\u2019t be saved from its need (and/or appetite) to eat certain proteins by some fancy new technology swooping in to enable a sudden mass low-carbon shift in food production that\u2019s able to eliminate animal farming overnight (because the most potentially transformative, low carbon alternatives for growing and harvesting protein are still being developed and/or scaled up) \u2014 and also accept that we will need to rely on large scale, land-based agriculture for many more years to come (since plant-based nutrients constitute the bulk of many people\u2019s diets right now and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future) \u2014 then some environmental improvement of agriculture is better than nothing, is the regenerative pragmatist\u2019s argument.\n\nTowards sustainable farming?\n\nDiscussing some of the environmental critiques of regenerative agriculture, Gerlach appears to entrench his support even further \u2014 straying towards backing a notion (which has, by the way, been heavily promoted by the meat industry) that even livestock farming could be made sustainable with the right interventions (and/or in certain contexts).\n\n\u201cEven cattle you can raise in a way where you have significantly reduced climate impact,\u201d he argues. \u201cAnd that in itself is an advantage. Of course we all know we need to transition the popular away from a predominantly meat-based diet but then you have a question that others need to answer\u2026 whether there should still be a role for animal husbandry at all or zero?\n\n\u201cBut if you are in a space where you are raising cattle, for example, you can do so with significantly reduced climate impact. And there are scientific studies that claim you can even raise cattle in a climate positive way.\u201d\n\nHe does not specify which scientific studies he\u2019s referring to \u2014 but a five-month investigation into meat industry lobbying tactics conducted by DeSmog last year found suspiciously similar climatewashing claims featuring in its PR and lobbying. (DeSmog summarized its findings as follows: \u201cDownplaying the impact of livestock farming on the climate; casting doubt on the efficacy of alternatives to meat to combat climate change; promoting the health benefits of meat while overlooking the industry\u2019s environmental footprint; exaggerating the potential of agricultural innovations to reduce the livestock industry\u2019s ecological impact.\u201d So, yeah, uncanny.)\n\nOne thing is clear: The greenwashing pitfalls are real given how much meat industry cash is being sloshed around to try to deflect climate blame and derail change \u2014 but it\u2019s also fair to say that so are the challenges of transitioning consumers to alternative proteins en masse fast.\n\nMany consumers are unlikely to stomach a too-swift transition away from traditionally farmed meat \u2014 although if the full environmental costs of meat production were reflected in the price people paid then their diets might be rather swiftly reconfigured. (And we may well soon see this effect in practice, as the energy crisis drives food inflation that\u2019s hitting meat producers especially hard \u2014 given that it\u2019s such an inefficient way of producing protein for human consumption.)\n\nMeat alternatives have traditionally been more expensive for consumers to buy but as that changes it\u2019s likely a lot more people will find an appetite for textured vegetable proteins.\n\nAt the same time, food is of course cultural, personal and, at times, political \u2014 what we eat (or don\u2019t) can often be incredibly polarizing. So while demand for plant-based diets is absolutely on the rise \u2014 especially among younger generations who understand the urgency of the climate emergency \u2014 societal tastes rarely change overnight. (Although, again, the cost of living crisis might just be the lever that flips the West to a predominantly plant-based diet.)\n\nBut the pragmatist\u2019s view of regenerative agriculture is still that it\u2019s a necessary evolutionary step on the road to reforming food systems, and that \u2014 by promoting the use of less environmentally harmful methods, even for heavily polluting industries such as dairy farming \u2014 it can at least help shrink the emissions toll of some major climate sinners in the meanwhile.\n\nGerlach also suggests that, unlike in the US, the predominant application for regenerative agriculture in Europe is plant-based farming in any case. And he says Klim\u2019s platform does not currently include any livestock methods \u2014 although it is supporting some farmers who are producing animal feed (such as grass for dairy cows) \u2014 so it is attached to the supply chain of animal-derived foods. And as it begins to scale uptake of its platform via international expansion there is a question over whether or not it will end up feeling pressure to open up to livestock methods too.\n\nReduction and transition\n\n\u201cWe are agnostic. We are working with industries that are purely plant-based. And we are also working with the dairy industry \u2014 who need to reduce their emissions significantly,\u201d says Gerlach of where Klim stands now. \u201cRegenerative agriculture can play a huge role in reducing the emissions of also of industries that are in the dairy industry. And any reduction of emissions right now that we can achieve is a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake to say regenerative is cattle \u2014 because it simply isn\u2019t,\u201d he also asserts. \u201cWe are currently rewarding only agricultural methods \u2014 for example the cover crop, the catch crop \u2014 so plant-based methods. That\u2019s \u2014 at the moment \u2014 what we do.\u201d\n\nOn the question of whether there is any tension between an approach that\u2019s focused on encouraging a reduction in emissions, whatever the farmer is doing \u2014 and claims therefore to be \u201cclimate-positive\u201d \u2014 but which isn\u2019t supporting farmers to make a full-fat transition to low carbon agriculture (i.e. if they\u2019re doing a type of farming that sustains high carbon livestock farming), Gerlach argues that both reduction and transition need to happen in parallel. He also suggests there are signs this is already happening, such as around dairy with the rise of plant-based milks and vegan cheeses.\n\n\u201cRight now \u2014 at least in the most developed countries \u2014 there is a clear transition away from dairy-based products. If you go to the supermarket now and compare the milk shelves to ten years ago, currently you have over half a milk and almost nothing dairy based. That goes on in parallel,\u201d he argues. \u201cAnd at the same time what you already have right now and still have you need to reduce the impact \u2014 so you\u2019re absolutely right; you need to tackle both things: Transition and reduction in parallel. Only then do you have a chance to achieve the climate targets.\u201d\n\nBut isn\u2019t there a risk that regenerative agriculture \u2014 by allowing farmers to apply an environmentally friendly sounding label to small changes in their methods rather than transformative leaps \u2014 it could actually slow the transition to low carbon food production that\u2019s critically needed if we\u2019re to avert climate disaster?\n\n\u201cMay I ask the question in return?\u201d he responds. \u201cImagine you have a large company that is considering to reduce the emissions from their dairy production by 50%. Would you tell them not to do it because they should rather go out of business or would you help them to reduce the emissions?\u201d\n\nWe counter by pointing out there\u2019s another option: Provide support to those farmers to transition away from dairy to plant-based agriculture. \u201cWell, you will have to offer both things,\u201d Gerlach suggests. \u201cOur role is actually to enable the transition to regenerative agriculture \u2014 and to that role we are, in a way, bound. So I think both things happen but the transition of moving from a meat-based to a plant-based economy is one that is driven by the consumer.\u201d\n\nHe also argues \u2014 quite rightly \u2014 that climate change won\u2019t have one simple \u2018panacea\u2019 fix. Change is certainly needed wholesale, everywhere, root and branch, across every industry and sector.\n\nHowever that shouldn\u2019t be used as an excuse to sustain the unsustainable \u2014 and risk delaying an already dangerously overdue transition to sustainable food production. There are already plenty of viable low carbon protein alternatives that can take the place of animal-derived proteins on the plate. (Vegetarian food is not some fancy new invention, after all; large swathes of the developing world have long consumed a predominantly plant-based diet.)\n\nSo there\u2019s undoubtedly a balance to be struck here between hand-holding farmers and consumers and express-fixing an industrialized food system that\u2019s dragging us down the path to climate disaster at top speed.\n\nGerlach makes another point that if one region were to make a too radically sudden switch away from livestock farming or producing animal-derived proteins it could just drive demand for the same food to produced elsewhere but less sustainably \u2014 i.e. to cater to ongoing consumer demand which local farmers have stopped serving \u2014 with the risk of an overall net negative for the climate as emissions are \u2018outsourced\u2019, rather than shrunk.\n\nSo yes, there are certainly complex and intertwined impacts to consider. But, also, with the right policy nudges and incentives, there should be ways to mitigate such risks and create appetite for locally produced low carbon alternatives. (Such as, for example, by championing homegrown \u2018true climate\u2019 farming heroes.)\n\nCollective action\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re totally rational about it, the question you ask is precisely the right one: Where do you have the biggest climate impact?\u201d Gerlach concedes. \u201cIf you now say dairy industry you should not reduce your emissions you should go out of business \u2014 or if you should say you should slowly reduce your production, because consumer demand does it, and what you still produce \u2014 or need to produce \u2014 you should reduce your emissions? I personally believe in a combination.\n\n\u201cThe question you ask \u2014 whether you slow down a transition \u2014 of course it\u2019s a justified question. I personally don\u2019t think you do. I think the transition towards a plant-based diet is such a strong movement right now nothing will slow that down and, if anything, regenerative agriculture will accelerate it.\n\n\u201cWhy? Because regenerative agriculture has another benefit: With regenerative agriculture I regenerate the soil, I improve the nutrition availability in the soil, and I improve the nutrition density of the vegetarian food \u2014 the plant-based food \u2014 that I generate so I make it a higher quality. So actually you increase the demand for regeneratively sourced plant-based food which should actually drive the \u2018from red to green\u2019 transition even faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to always look at the reality of where we are now \u2014 and where we need to be in 10, and 20 and 50 years,\u201d he also argues, suggesting that regenerative agriculture has an inescapable role to play in climate action as part of a cross-cutting collective. \u201cI know that currently everything in the food sector is about alternative proteins and meat. It would not be fair to reduce regenerative agriculture to cattle raising and therefore compare it to meat alternatives\u2026 It would be misleading.\n\n\u201cEven if you would assume we could raise protein and perhaps even other nutritions completely in the factory right now and even if you assume we can do so with an energy balance that is better than natural farming, which most people actually doubt, you would still need to create a roadmap to feed 8BN people this way. And on that roadmap there\u2019s clearly a role for agriculture. If anybody tells you in the next 10 or 20 years there\u2019s a case for feeding 8BN people without agriculture then I don\u2019t know what to say anymore. So if you accept that you need agriculture to feed 8BN people at least in the next 20 years \u2014 and, I wager, much longer; permanently \u2014 then you also need to accept that reducing the climate emissions from this form of natural agriculture is a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that with artificial proteins alone we can now achieve the 1.5 degrees temperature target,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that we could scale up alternative proteins in the next five years to feed 8BN people so that we don\u2019t need agriculture at all anymore and that we achieve the 1.5 degree target. That I don\u2019t believe. If it\u2019s possible then I would be very happy because I\u2019m most of all concerned about the climate. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. So the simple answer is \u2014 if that hypothesis is true then you need agriculture and if you need agriculture then it is a good thing to reduce the emissions in agriculture.\u201d\n\nFew would likely argue with Gerlach on the \u2018moonshot\u2019 artificial proteins point. But there may be more debate about whether the gentler, more incremental transition allowed for by regenerative proponents can really hope to shrink carbon emissions fast enough for us to avoid suffering major climate harms.\n\nClearly it will take massive uptake of regenerative methods \u2014 whole continents of farmers switching, not just a few villages\u2019 worth of farms \u2014 to stand any chance of having the scale of impact requires. But Gerlach\u2019s point is that if every industry takes up the baton to phase down emissions in collective parallel there\u2019s reason for hope.\n\n\u201cIf we want to have any realistic chance of achieving the 1.5 degree temperature targets we need to A) stop dreaming about some far away, not ready technologies that will never be able to scale up to achieve that goal. B) we need to be able to reduce emissions in all sectors, massively, not only in food production \u2014 in industrial production, in home energy use, everywhere. And we need to capture as much CO2 from the atmosphere in the form of negative emissions and store as much as we can in soils, in biomass, or elsewhere,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of all the technologies that are available \u2014 each one of them pushed like crazy. And only if we all work together, and if we all say it\u2019s better to actually make an impact now, even though not perfect, than to say it\u2019s not perfect and therefore I rather don\u2019t do anything at all \u2014 only then do we have a chance.\u201d\n\nSeen from that perspective, \u2018climate sinning\u2019 farmers doing their bit to go greener can form a meaningful piece of a \u2018climate-positive\u2019 collective action patchwork. Or, well, that\u2019s the hope.\n\nThis report was updated with a correction: We originally reported that Klim\u2019s platform does not currently include any livestock farmers, which was what we understood we were told \u2014 however Klim said that\u2019s not right; rather it does not include any livestock methods in the regenerative mix it\u2019s promoting"}
