In April 2012, Oculus hit Kickstarter with the Oculus Rift developer kit, and the tech world whipped itself into a \u201cthis is the future\u201d frenzy. Facebook slapped a $2 billion check on the table and acquired the company in 2014.\n\nBut today, as it stands, VR is all but dead.\n\nVR \u2014 as in, a system for being exclusively in virtual reality \u2014 barely exists as a concept anymore. Even the cheapest mainstream headset out there, the Meta Quest 2, has a passthrough feature, meaning it\u2019s got AR capabilities. The Quest 3 adds higher-definition passthrough in full color. And, $3,500 price tag aside, Apple\u2019s Vision Pro takes the concept so far that it doesn\u2019t even really use the VR nomenclature anymore.\n\nThat\u2019s because VR is missing the one crucial thing that could\u2019ve taken it from \u201ccool toy\u201d to \u201cmust-have device\u201d: a killer app. Even as the market has matured, VR is still struggling to find a reason to exist.\n\nIn 2015, TechCrunch published an article that speculated that the market could hit $150 billion of revenue by 2020. Here we are, nearing 2024, and it looks like the market sits at around $32 billion \u2014 a fifth of what the breathless analysts were guessing.\n\nSo what happened? Well, not enough, and that\u2019s the problem. Even the newest headsets aren\u2019t that comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, so perhaps it\u2019s a good thing there\u2019s rarely a good reason to use them for long stretches of time.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

A lot of Apple\u2019s demo material for its new headset focuses on making the experience in a headset more integrated with the out-of-headset experience. It appears that most of the equipment manufacturers agree that if mainstream users don\u2019t like being isolated in a dive mask with a screen welded to the inside, you have to rethink how the platform works.\n\nCanon tried to make VR calling a thing. I tried it out. It\u2019s neat, and I was impressed by what the company did. But it wasn\u2019t enough. There are some use cases for mixed and augmented reality \u2014 very basic heads-up displays and involved games and productivity apps, to name a few \u2014 but a solution doesn\u2019t just have to be as good as the existing solutions. They have to be sufficiently better \u2014 so much so that people are willing to learn a whole new interaction paradigm.\n\nSo far, that\u2019s where we\u2019ve come up short. I still believe that Apple bursting through the wall like Kool-Aid Man with a \u201cHey, look what we built!\u201d will completely shift the industry: A new generation of startups will see the market as mature enough to start building applications. I think it\u2019s time we write off VR altogether. I\u2019m curious whether AR has what it takes to take the baton and run with it. Even with the tailwind generated by the world\u2019s most valuable company joining the fray, I\u2019m still struggling to come up with ways that AR can be more than a novelty. But I would be foolish to bet against Apple, and most of the other VR companies have shown their hand as well: They are all on the AR train, and the tech world may just have enough curiosity to try again.\n\nThe VR king is dead. Long live the AR king."}
