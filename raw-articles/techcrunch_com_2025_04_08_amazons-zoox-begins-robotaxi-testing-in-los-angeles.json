Unlike rival Waymo, which is already providing paid robotaxi rides in LA, Zoox is still in the early stages. This deployment will send out manually driven Toyota Highlanders equipped with Zoox\u2019s self-driving tech to gather mapping data ahead of broader autonomous testing in LA this summer.\n\nZoox is currently testing its autonomous vehicles \u2014 both the Highlander test fleet and its purpose-built robotaxis made without a steering wheel or pedals \u2014 in several cities. Notably, Zoox has expanded the areas where its purpose-built robotaxi is testing on public roads in Foster City, San Francisco, and Las Vegas without a human driver. Zoox recently allowed employees, media, and other vetted guests to try the service.\n\nThe company is also testing in Austin, Miami, and Seattle using Highlanders with human safety operators behind the wheel.\n\nThe expansion in California comes a few weeks after Zoox issued a voluntary software recall on 258 vehicles due to issues with its autonomous driving system unexpectedly hard braking.\n\nZoox\u2019s entry into Los Angeles follows Waymo\u2019s launch of a fully autonomous commercial robotaxi service in the city. To date, Waymo is the only AV company in the U.S. that offers a paid service in several cities, including the Bay Area, Phoenix, and Austin. The Alphabet-owned company aims to launch a commercial service in Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C. over the next two years.\n\nThis article has been updated with more information from Zoox."}
