But thanks to some important breakthroughs in the last several months, investors are betting on promising startups in the space to make the concept of super-efficient, particle- and electron-based computing a reality.\n\nNow, Quantum Machines, an Israeli startup that provides quantum control solutions to others in the field, has raised $170 million.\n\nLed by PSG Equity with participation from Intel Capital, Red Dot Capital Partners, and existing investors, this all-equity Series C round is one of the biggest funding rounds raised by a quantum computing company to date.\n\nOne reason for the size of the round is because of the startup\u2019s business funnel. Quantum Machines\u2019 technology is now used by more than half of all the companies in the world that are working on quantum computers and quantum computing, according to its CEO, Dr. Itamar Sivan, who co-founded the company with CTO Dr. Yonatan Cohen and chief engineer Dr. Nissim Ofek.\n\n\u201cWe serve every category of company in the field,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201clarge corporates, startups building quantum computers, national labs globally, and universities.\u201d\n\nQuantum Machines\u2019 hardware may be best known for its traction with customers and partners like Nvidia who want to reduce errors in their own quantum computing research. This is a critical role in the wider ecosystem as researchers get closer to building functional, super-fast quantum computers that do not fall over with high fail rates.\n\nSivan declined to name any of those specific customers \u2014 although the list of tech companies backing the startup might be a good hint. However, he noted that its hundreds of clients also include companies that are not owners or developers of quantum computers themselves, but banks and others that are running research on third-party machines, in the cloud, and use Quantum Machines to keep that work on track.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For some more context, when we and others first heard about the round earlier this year, the value was pegged at $100 million.\n\nPrior to this round, the company had raised around $93 million, per Crunchbase data. Valor Equity Partners, Alumni Ventures, Battery Ventures, Samsung NEXT, and Qualcomm Ventures are among its backers.\n\nQuantum computing had a burst of cold wind in January, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a public prediction that the technology was still \u201cdecades away\u201d from being useful (despite his company\u2019s work with Quantum Machines, Google, and others). It was a statement that sent quantum stocks and overall outlook tumbling.\n\nYet, we\u2019ve since seen several positive developments that might pave the way for a different timeline. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google \u2014 which unveiled a quantum chip it called Willow in December \u2014 earlier this month said a realistic time frame for \u201cuseful\u201d quantum computers was five to 10 years from now.\n\nMicrosoft followed that up just last week by unveiling its own quantum processor that\u2019s built using what it described as \u201ca new state of matter\u201d called the Majorana particle. The company said it holds promise in building processors that contain 1 million qubits \u2014 a thousand times bigger than the typically 1,000 qubit processors being used today.\n\nSome have raised questions about Microsoft\u2019s claims due to a lack of evidence, but it\u2019s still an important development that underscores the work that is being done.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of startups have been raising large rounds. These include Alice & Bob in France raising $104 million and Google-backed QuEra raising $230 million in a debt round.\n\nThere remain question marks over the best approaches in the space. For example, some are building along a few different theoretical trajectories around how to construct processors and the best approaches for addressing errors. But as Sivan points out, this is what makes Quantum Machines effective: Bypassing those questions, it positions itself as agnostic to all those approaches, and as a mediator for reducing noise, both figuratively and literally.\n\nThis is one reason the startup has attracted the investment that is has, said Rotem Shacham, a director at PSG.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years the pace of tech breakthroughs in quantum computing have increased significantly,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer to end user values. We don\u2019t like to invest decades away. But with Quantum Machines the market is already there.\u201d"}
