The feature is a simple way to increase engagement with the creator\u2019s content, but it could also offer creators and celebrities a way to share exclusive reels with their most dedicated fans, who are more likely to know the answer to hints.\n\nFor example, a creator may lock a reel with the hint, \u201cmy birthday\u201d or \u201cmy dog\u2019s name\u201d in order to share exclusive content with loyal followers.\n\nThe Meta-owned social network was spotted testing the feature on its Design account, where it shared a locked reel that prompts viewers to \u201cEnter secret code.\u201d The hint for the code is \u201c1st # in the caption.\u201d In this case, the code is \u201cthreads\u201d \u2014 a reference to the first hashtag mentioned in the caption. Once you unlock the reel, you\u2019ll see a banner that says \u201ccoming soon,\u201d which appears to be the Design account\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s launching a profile on Threads.\n\nInstagram did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment to learn more about this feature, but the test was spotted being tested on a public account.\n\nImage Credits:Instagram (Screenshot/TechCrunch)\n\nThe new feature could also be used by creators and brands to launch promotions or marketing campaigns in a fun way. For instance, they could use locked reels for product reveals or to create buzz around launches.\n\nAs for regular users, the new feature could be a fun way to share content with specific friends.\n\nOf course, some people may not want to engage with locked reels and spend time trying to find secret codes, especially since Instagram is already flooded with tons of different types of content and features.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That feature launched last year as a way to create more intimate connections on the app and boost engagement.\n\nAs with any other test feature, it\u2019s unknown when or if Instagram plans to roll out locked reels widely.\n\n"}
