Companies have IoT device administration to worry about, and also building out the infrastructure necessary to keep those devices connected and operational.\n\nTo make it easier, five former co-workers \u2014 Pasi Leip\u00e4l\u00e4, Teemu Vaattovaara, Jyrki Okkonen, Ville Yll\u00e4sjarvi and Toni Leinonen \u2014 founded Haltian, a startup that provides a portfolio of sensors, cellular gateways, device management dashboards and software to help companies orchestrate IoT in the workplace.\n\nShowing investors are keen on the idea, Haltian recently closed a \u20ac22 million (~$24 million) funding round led by Mandatum Asset Management Growth Equity with participation from Varma, Tesi, Ventic and Inventure. Bringing the company\u2019s total funding to date to \u20ac40 million (~$43.7 million), Leip\u00e4l\u00e4, Haltian\u2019s CEO, says that it\u2019ll be put toward supporting international expansion in Central Europe and North America, as well as Haltian\u2019s recruiting efforts.\n\nKitty Laine, an investment manager at Mandatum Asset Management, said via email: \u201cWe were drawn to Haltian as they are able to digitize the built environment and create savings for their customers from data that was not available before. Their cloud-connected smart sensors and top-notch R&D has received excellent feedback from demanding U.S.-based customers, and we have been excited to see how Haltian\u2019s products are gaining traction in international markets.\u201d\n\nThe IoT market has proven resilient to the ups and downs of the broader technology space, with data from Crunchbase showing that the average amount of capital raised by IoT startups in 2022 reached the highest point in over a decade.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Haltian isn\u2019t the only startup vying for a slice of the substantial VC pie. Recently, a startup called Memfault raised $24 million for its platform designed to help companies manage their growing IoT device fleets. Elsewhere, Fleet has secured tens of millions of dollars for its device management software. There\u2019s also Esper, which landed $30 million in May 2021 to grow its IoT DevOps platform.\n\nWhat sets Haltian apart, Leip\u00e4l\u00e4 \u2014 the CEO \u2014 says, is the exhaustiveness of its product offering. Leip\u00e4l\u00e4 and Haltian\u2019s other co-founders previously worked at Nokia in one of the firm\u2019s smartphone divisions, where the seed of the idea for Haltian came from.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Our own IoT products started to be developed after a couple of years, with income earned from engineering services,\u201d Leip\u00e4l\u00e4 told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cHaltian is one of the few companies able to provide a full stack IoT solution. We\u2019re able to customize any . . . element according to customer requirements.\u201d\n\nThrough a combination of sensors and AI algorithms, Haltian\u2019s platform can count the number of people in an office or building or track things like CO2 and humidity levels. It can also monitor for light usage, leaks and dips in temperature as well as detect when paper, towel and soap dispensers are about to run low.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of sensitive data that Haltian is collecting. But Leip\u00e4l\u00e4 asserts that it\u2019s anonymized and stored in a private cloud. (Absent a glance at the customer service agreement, we\u2019ll have to take his word for it.)\n\n\u201cFor Haltian, scalability is not only about how many devices can connect to a single gateway, but how thousands of implementation locations can be served logistically as well as how easy and fast the installation, onboarding and life cycle management can be done,\u201d he added.\n\nA factor working in Haltian\u2019s favor is the growing interest in IoT among the enterprise. In a 2021 survey by Omdia, the London-based consultancy firm, 90% of organizations said that they saw IoT as core to their digital transformation plans or being deployed across multiple areas of their organization. A separate report by Gartner, published a year earlier, estimated that 47% of organizations plan to increase their investments in IoT, with the goal of reducing costs and bolstering their overall digital transformation efforts.\n\nInterestingly, around 75% of Haltian\u2019s revenue comes from sales of its IoT devices, Leip\u00e4l\u00e4 says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown annually at a rate of nearly 50% over the last three years, reaching revenues of around \u20ac20 million (~$21.85 million) last year,\u201d Leip\u00e4l\u00e4 said. \u201cSince the pandemic, there has been increased focus on making office designs aligned with the company cultures, accompanied by supporting technologies \u2014 e.g., IoT solutions. At the same time, IoT sensor solutions have become more affordable, cost-effective and easier to implement.\u201d\n\nRiding the upward trend, Haltian recently expanded to the U.S. and Amsterdam, opening offices in California and Holland. So far, it\u2019s raised a total of \u20ac40 million (~$43.71 million) and plans to grow its employee base from 145 people to around 170 by the end of the year."}
