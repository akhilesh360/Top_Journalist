When Meta finds an account that it suspects belongs to a teen, the platform will enroll them into a restricted Teen Account, even if the account lists an adult birthday.\n\nTeen Accounts, which launched on Instagram last year, enroll young users into an app experience with built-in protections. The safeguards are applied to teens automatically, and limit who can contact a teen on the app and restrict the type of content the account holder can view. Teens under the age of 16 need their parents\u2019 permission to change any of these settings.\n\nInstagram has been using AI to determine age for quite some time, but now the social network confirms it\u2019s using the technology to ensure that teens are accessing Instagram via a Teen Account rather than an adult one.\n\nThe company told TechCrunch last year that it had planned to do this, and noted that some of the ways it would find accounts that belong to teens who entered a fake adult birthday is by detecting happy birthday posts and receiving reports from other users.\n\nImage Credits:Meta\n\nInstagram says that it\u2019s taking steps to ensure that its technology is accurate and that it\u2019s correctly placing teens into Teen Accounts. However, in case the company does make a mistake, it\u2019s giving people the option to change their settings.\n\n\u201cThe digital world continues to evolve and we have to evolve with it,\u201d the company wrote in its blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we work together with parents to make sure as many teens as possible have the protective settings that come with Teen Accounts.\u201d\n\nInstagram also announced that it\u2019s going to begin sending notifications to parents that include information about how they can discuss the importance of providing the correct age online with their teens. The platform notes that one of the most important ways parents can make sure their teens are in protected accounts is to check if their account lists their correct birthday.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
