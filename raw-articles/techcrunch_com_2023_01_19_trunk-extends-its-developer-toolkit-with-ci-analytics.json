The new service helps developers understand how their CI Workflows (currently with a focus on GitHub Actions) perform in the real world \u2014 and if there are any trends they should be aware of.\n\nFounded in 2021 by a group of former Uber engineers, Trunk already offers Trunk Check, a tool for checking code quality, and Trunk Merge, a service that orchestrates merging pull requests. With CI Analytics, it\u2019s now expanding this feature set with another tool that tries to help developers work more efficiently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d run these surveys and the number one issue coming back from folks is \u2018the hardest part of my job is landing code and merging code into main.\u2019 That\u2019s insane. We\u2019re trying to build future-forward tech to make cars drive themselves and the hardest thing for the engineers is to put their code into the codebase,\u201d Trunk co-founder and co-CEO Eli Schleifer told me of his time at Uber. \u201cEvery company has to invest a tremendous amount of money into this stuff and you really don\u2019t want to hire 30 engineers \u2014 that\u2019s how many were at Uber \u2014 to build this solution, because it\u2019s not germane to your problem space. It\u2019s just the core tax you pay.\u201d\n\nSchleifer described the new analytics service as an \u201cengineering intelligence solution\u201d that helps developers fix broken engineering workflows. He noted that while GitHub Actions has become very popular in a short amount of time, it\u2019s also a bit of a black box. \u201cThere are a lot of engineering intelligence tools out there that will tell you that this engineer wrote this many lines of code or this many commits. We see engineering intelligence more as a tool to help the productivity of all the engineers,\u201d Schleifer said. If Trunk can help these engineers find inefficiencies in their CI processes, then, he argues, it will make everybody in the engineering organization more efficient.\n\n\u201cWithout a proper engineering intelligence solution, DevOps and engineering teams are left operating in the dark and engineers are left to guess at what parts of their build and test workflows are slowing down engineering,\u201d said Schleifer. \u201cTrunk CI Analytics eliminates the guesswork with beautiful trend lines, anomaly alerting and the ability to perform deep historical analysis within a few clicks. Operating without this level of engineering intelligence can be the difference between shipping code on time and slowly grinding to a halt.\u201d\n\nThe new service is now available to all Trunk users, with pricing starting at $7 per month and user (after a free two-week trial)."}
