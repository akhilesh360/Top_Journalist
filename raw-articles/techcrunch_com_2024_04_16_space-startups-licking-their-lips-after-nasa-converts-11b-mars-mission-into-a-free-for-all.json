But the strategy shift could be a huge boon to space startups, to which much of that planned funding will almost certainly be redirected.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, an $11 billion budget is too expensive, and a 2040 return date is too far away,\u201d Nelson said at a press conference. \u201cWe need to look outside the box to find a way ahead that is both affordable and returns samples in a reasonable timeframe.\u201d\n\nIn other words, clear the decks and start over \u2014 with commercial providers on board from the get-go.\n\nThe Mars Sample Return mission was still in the planning stages, but an independent review of the project last year found that, given budget, technology and other constraints, the mission was unlikely to complete before 2040, and at a cost of $8 billion to $11 billion.\n\nThough NASA proposed a revised plan in the mold of the original, it has now also challenged the space community to go further: \u201cNASA soon will solicit architecture proposals from industry that could return samples in the 2030s, and lowers cost, risk, and mission complexity.\u201d\n\nConsidering how heavily both primes and space startups have been investing in interplanetary capability, this announcement arguably amounts to a historic windfall. A company like Intuitive Machines, riding high after accomplishing the first private lunar landing, will almost certainly be firing on all cylinders to take on what could be a multi-billion-dollar contract.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

That was undoubtedly also the plan with the 2040 timeline, but the notional new one is a lot closer to the present.\n\nBetween the lines can be seen the admission that any mission planned before the present bloom of orbital and interplanetary capability is, very simply, no longer feasible. Although NASA\u2019s troubled Space Launch System heavy launch vehicle is perhaps the largest such project, to abandon it now would be to throw away a great deal, while preemptively opting for a leaner Mars program fueled by commercial ambitions seems to have no obvious downside. (There\u2019s plenty of time to save and repurpose the most important concepts and research already done by NASA and its partners.)\n\nNo doubt that many of the companies this decision stands to benefit \u2014 not just startups and growing space companies but also primes and launch providers \u2014 saw the writing on the wall and have been looking forward to this day. But the official announcement, and the implication that it is the new generation of space companies that will accomplish ambitious goals like a there-and-back trip to Mars, must be very validating.\n\nTo be clear, there is no money on the table just yet \u2014 but the promise has essentially been made that what would have belonged to the Mars Sample Return mission will be repurposed according to whatever new plan the expansive \u201cNASA community\u201d decides on. Whatever that new plan may be, it will almost certainly rely far more than before on commercial services and hardware.\n\nJust as the Commercial Lunar Payload Services accelerated and incentivized the proliferation of vehicles, spacecraft and landers we see today \u2014 including some by companies that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago \u2014 the newly recast Mars Sample Return mission may have fired the starting gun on commercial ambitions for the red planet."}
