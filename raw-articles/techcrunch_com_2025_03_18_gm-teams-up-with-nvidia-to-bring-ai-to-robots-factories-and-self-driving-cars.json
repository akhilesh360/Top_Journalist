Nvidia has also developed an autonomous vehicle platform for automakers that includes an operating system called DriveOS to provide real-time AI processing and integration of advanced driving and cockpit features. Toyota announced earlier this year plans to equip next-generation vehicles with automated driving capabilities powered by Nvidia\u2019s Drive AGX Orin supercomputer and safety-focused operating system, DriveOS.\n\n\u201cWe work with the car industry however the car industry would like us to work with them,\u201d Huang said during the keynote. \u201cWe build all three computers: the training computer, the simulation computer, and the robotics computer (the self-driving car computer) \u2014 all the software stack that sits on top of it, the models and algorithms just as we do with all of the other industries that I\u2019ve demonstrated.\u201d\n\n\n\nGM plans to work with Nvidia to build custom AI systems using several of the tech giant\u2019s products. GM did not disclose the financial value of the deal.\n\nGM will use Nvidia Omniverse with Cosmos to train AI manufacturing models to help it build next-generation factories and robotics. Using Omniverse, GM will be able to build a digital twin of its factories \u2014 and even assembly lines \u2014 to virtually test new production processes without disrupting existing vehicle production. The effort will include training robotics platforms GM is already using for operations such as material handling and transport, and precision welding.\n\nThe automaker will also use Nvidia Drive AGX for its in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences. The automaker recently stopped funding its commercial robotaxi development business in a pivot that has shifted resources toward its hands-off advanced driver-assistance system known as Super Cruise. GM is in the process of absorbing its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise and combining it with its own efforts to develop driver-assistance features \u2014 and eventually fully autonomous personal vehicles.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
