The company announced these experiments at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday.\n\nStarting this month, Peacock will begin piloting the new features on its iOS and Android apps before a broader rollout later this spring. During the initial testing phase, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that some users will see both the games and the vertical video playlists, whereas some will see one or the other, and some will see neither.\n\nThe platform is likely trying to keep pace with other major streaming services as it faces challenges in subscriber growth. Peacock lags significantly, with only 36 million subscribers compared to Netflix\u2019s impressive 282.72 million, nearly 85 million of which hail from the U.S. and Canada. (And roughly 66.7 million are from the U.S. alone, dwarfing Peacock.)\n\nSince introducing its gaming division in 2021, Netflix has launched over 120 games. YouTube and Sling TV have also rolled out free gaming offerings to compete.\n\nImage Credits:Peacock\n\nPeacock is currently testing five games: Daily Sort, Daily Swap, Predictions, What The, and Venn. These fast-paced games aim to enhance fan involvement with the most popular titles, as they offer gameplay influenced by TV shows and sports programming. Linking games to popular IP is a smart move, as it attracts players who are interested in those titles.\n\nFor example, with Venn, players sort items into the appropriate circles based on a daily theme that relates to episodes of shows like \u201cBelow Deck.\u201d The Predictions game allows users to predict the outcomes of specific shows and sporting events, enabling them to return later and see how accurate their guesses were.\n\nImage Credits:Peacock\n\nMeanwhile, the streaming platform is also testing new curated vertical video playlists, which will feature short clips from Peacock\u2019s entire library, such as TV shows, movies, sports, and news. These will be updated daily and weekly, with many clips debuting exclusively on the app. Users can tap on the clips to be directed to the respective show\u2019s page, making it easy to jump in and watch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The latest test takes after Tubi, the Fox-owned free ad-supported streaming service, which also embraced short-form video with its new feature called \u201cScenes.\u201d"}
