It is estimated that the charge card pilot program contract for which Ramp is being considered is worth up to $25 million, according to a report by Pro Publica.\n\nPro Publica claims that fintech Ramp has been lobbying for the administration\u2019s attention since January, before President Trump was sworn in.\n\nIn January, Ramp co-founder CEO Eric Glyman and Ramp VC investor Kyle Harrison wrote a blog post titled \u201cThe Efficiency Formula\u201d in which they listed the ways they imagined the government could \u201celiminate inefficient spending.\u201d Harrison is a general partner at the firm Contrary.\n\nThe post seemed to be an appeal to Elon Musk\u2019s government agenda \u2014 which would be formally created a few days later as the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 considering Ramp has ties to Musk\u2019s and Trump\u2019s world. Ramp\u2019s investors include Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund; Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures; Thrive Capital, which was founded by Joshua Kushner, brother of Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared; Trump ally 8VC\u2019s Joe Lonsdale and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and brother of former Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nRamp \u201cis competing in a standard procurement process for a SmartPay pilot program based on the strength of our solution,\u201d Lindsay McKinley, head of communications told TechCrunch on Thursday.\n\nShe added: \u201cRamp\u2019s technology has prevented billions of dollars in wasted spend across the economy, and if chosen, we\u2019ll bring those same results to the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It offers similar spend management features as other corporate expense management platforms, like setting parameters to identify expenses that don\u2019t conform to policies. The federal government has many such policies for employees in place.\n\nMcKinley said that the startup saw a public post on X shared by the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, on February 18 that said \u201cthe US government currently has ~4.6M active credit cards/accounts, which processed ~90M unique transactions for ~$40B of spend in FY24.\u201d\n\nA former customer, Ramp claims, introduced Ramp to GSA a few days later.\n\n\u201cSince then we have demonstrated the product and are now part of a standard RFI process,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no indication of whether we\u2019ll be selected.\u201d\n\nIn March, Ramp doubled its valuation to $13 billion after a $150 million secondary share sale. The startup has raised over $1 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding since its 2019 inception."}
