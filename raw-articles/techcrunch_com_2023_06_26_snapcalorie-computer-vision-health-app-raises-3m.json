He co-founded Google Lens, Google\u2019s computer vision-powered app that brings up information related to the objects it identifies. But it didn\u2019t quite scratch the itch.\n\nSo several years ago, Norris teamed up with Scott Baron, a systems engineer in the aerospace industry, to launch a health-focused startup called SnapCalorie. SnapCalorie, powered by AI, attempts to get an accurate calorie count and macronutrient breakdown of a meal from a single photo taken with a smartphone.\n\nThis month, SnapCalorie raised $2 million in funding from investors including Accel, Index Ventures, former CrossFit CEO Eric Roza and Y Combinator. The company previously raised $125,000 from unidentified investors in a pre-seed round.\n\n\u201cHuman beings are terrible at visually estimating the portion size of a plate of food,\u201d Norris said. \u201cSnapCalorie improves on the status quo by combining a variety of new technologies and algorithms.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, SnapCalorie isn\u2019t the first computer vision-based app for calorie counting. Apps such as Calorie Mama, Lose It, Foodadvisor and Bite.AI have all attempted the feat \u2014 to varying degrees of success. But what makes SnapCalorie different, Norris claims, is its use of depth sensors on supported devices for measuring portion size and a team of human reviewers for \u201can added layer of quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn average, the team is able to reduce the caloric error to under 20%,\u201d Norris says. \u201cThere are other apps capable of using AI to do photo-based meal tracking, but none of them help with portion size estimation \u2014 the most important part to reduce error.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of skepticism in the health industry around photo-driven calorie estimating tools \u2014 and for good reason. One 2020 study comparing some of the more popular AI-based calorie counters found that the most accurate \u2014 Calorie Mama \u2014 was only right about 63% of the time.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Beyond the use of depth sensors and reviewers, Norris points to an algorithm that the company developed that can ostensibly outperform a person at estimating a food\u2019s calories. Using the algorithm, SnapCalorie both identifies the types of food in a photo and measures the portion size of each to estimate the caloric content.\n\nThe results can be logged in SnapCalorie\u2019s food journal or exported to fitness-tracking platforms like Apple Health.\n\nThe algorithm\u2019s reported strong performance comes from its unique training dataset of 5,000 meals, Norris says, which SnapCalorie created by taking thousands of photos of each meal \u2014 e.g. soups, burritos, oils, \u201cmystery sauces\u201d and more \u2014 using a robotic rig.\n\n\u201cWe made sure these had all of the diverse and challenging conditions you\u2019d see in the real world and we weighed out every single ingredient on a scale,\u201d Norris said. \u201cThe traditional pipeline for training an AI model is to download public web images, have people label the images and then train the model to predict those labels. This isn\u2019t possible for food, because people are very inaccurate at visually estimating portion size, so you can\u2019t have people label the images after the fact.\u201d\n\nNorris admits that SnapCalorie\u2019s algorithm may be biased toward American food, since the team collected most of the initial training data in the U.S. But the company is in the process of expanding the training data \u2014 drawing both on photos from SnapCalorie\u2019s users and internal data \u2014 to include other cultural cuisines, he says.\n\nOne might argue that, no matter how accurate the algorithm, no app can give a truly accurate account of how many calories you ate in a meal. There\u2019s a range of variables apps don\u2019t consider, after all, like different cooking methods and the amount of time it takes to break down individual foods.\n\nNorris doesn\u2019t make the claim that SnapCalorie is 100% accurate, suggesting that the app\u2019s calorie estimating tools should be considered simply a piece of the larger nutrition puzzle. He spotlighted SnapCalorie\u2019s other major feature, a ChatGPT-powered chatbot, which gives meal suggestions informed by a user\u2019s goals and past preferences, as well as SnapCalorie\u2019s database of nutritional values.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that people\u2019s interest in understanding what they\u2019re putting in their bodies is on the rise. The negative health impacts of things like processed foods are becoming more and more clear every day,\u201d Norris said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that our users really like SnapCalorie especially when eating out, as many restaurants don\u2019t post nutrition values, and they would otherwise have no way of logging the meal.\u201d\n\nTo his point about popularity, SnapCalorie appears to be growing at a healthy clip \u2014 it\u2019s on track to break 1,000 new users this month. The company\u2019s focused on expansion at the moment as opposed to monetization, but Norris described the burn rate as \u201cvery conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur incredible organic growth rate seems to be indicative of our value proposition resonating well with consumers \u2014 people try it, love it and recommend it to their friends and family,\u201d he said."}
