To progress in the game, kids must complete math-related questions, which ensures they remain focused on their educational goals.\n\nThe startup announced on Monday its $1 million pre-seed funding round, which will help its platform reach additional markets. The raise was co-led by Blackbird Ventures and GD1. Notably, Liam Don, ClassDojo\u2019s chief technology officer, is an angel investor.\n\nImage Credits:Screenshot of Polymath platform by TechCrunch\n\nSophie Silver, co-founder and CEO of Polymath, studied human learning, memory, and developmental psychology at University College London (UCL). While working as a part-time nanny during her studies, she noticed a gap in children\u2019s mathematical abilities and realized it was becoming increasingly difficult to make lessons entertaining for them.\n\n\u201cThe kids really did not enjoy maths, and so I would start to invent games, mainly with cards or dice, to try and motivate them to do their multiplication or whatever they needed to do,\u201d Sophie Silver told TechCrunch. \u201c[I realized] the way that these kids are learning is not aligned with how the brain works.\u201d\n\nPolymath uses an adaptive algorithm to personalize learning for each child based on their progress. The company analyzes children\u2019s answers to identify the best question to ask next, recognizes knowledge gaps, and optimizes the timing of new information to prevent the kid from being overwhelmed.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For instance, if players want to build a house in the game, they need to measure the dimensions and calculate how many wood blocks they need.\n\nImage Credits:Polymath\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shopkeeper where you can buy things like resources from it, and sometimes that shopkeeper is unreliable and will give you the wrong price. Each block of wood costs 5 \u201ccubos\u201d (the currency in Polymath). You\u2019re asking to buy 4, but it\u2019s trying to charge you 30 cubos. That\u2019s a critical thinking moment for the student to recognize that the price is wrong,\u201d Christian Silver, co-founder and CTO, said.\n\nPolymath offers both an at-home version and a classroom version. The classroom version allows teachers to monitor students in real time. In this version, all players can work together in a shared space, answering questions simultaneously. If the classroom doesn\u2019t have enough devices available, Polymath has an option that calls on players to answer the next question, so every student is involved.\n\nThe at-home version enables parents to manage their child\u2019s experience and receive weekly email reports about their child\u2019s progress. There is also a parent app, Polymath Relate, where parents can view detailed answers to every question their child has answered.\n\nAdditionally, kids can connect with a friend on Polymath using a unique friend code. However, when playing in multiplayer mode, no chat function is available.\n\nPolymath launched in January 2023 through the Startmate accelerator in New Zealand. It has garnered thousands of users across Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and Virginia, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.\n\nFuture plans for the game include expanding the curriculum to offer more advanced learning opportunities and allowing for collaborative play, where kids can work together on problems. Additionally, Polymath plans to introduce purchasable avatar assets as a revenue stream in the future.\n\nPolymath is free to play on the web, iOS, and Android devices."}
