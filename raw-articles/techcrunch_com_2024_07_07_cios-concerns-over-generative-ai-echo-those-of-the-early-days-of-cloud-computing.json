Soon, they would resort to \u201cshadow IT\u201d to find those solutions on their own when IT said no, and no was the default in those days. It was easy enough for employees to go off on their own unless things went into total lockdown.\n\nToday, CIOs recognize if they just say no to generative AI, employees are probably going to find a way to use these tools anyway. There are plenty of legitimate concerns when it comes to this technology \u2014 like hallucinations or who owns the IP \u2014 but there are also concerns about security, compliance and controls, especially around data, that large organizations demand and require.\n\nBut CIOs speaking at the conference were much more realistic than they had been 15 years ago, even if they had similar concerns.\n\n\u201cYou know, everything\u2019s out there and democratized,\u201d said Mathematica CIO Akira Bell, speaking on a panel called \u201cSustaining Competitive Advantage in the Age of AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think somebody else this morning already said, \u2018You know, we can\u2019t control this moment.\u2019 We cannot and don\u2019t want to be \u2018the agents of no,\u2019 to tell everybody what they can and cannot do, but what we can do is make sure people understand the responsibility they have as actors and users of these tools.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Her organization can offer guidance on how to use these tools in a way that is consistent with the values of the company without shutting down access.\n\nAngelica Tritzo, CIO at GE Vernova, a new spinout from GE focused on alternative energy, is taking a deliberate approach to implementing generative AI. \u201cWe have a number of pilots in different maturity stages. We probably, like many others, do not fully understand the full potential, so the cost and the benefit is not always fully aligned,\u201d Tritzo told TechCrunch. \u201cWe are finding our way with all the pieces of technology, how much to partner with others versus what we need to do ourselves.\u201d But the process is helping her learn what works and what doesn\u2019t and how to proceed while helping employees get familiar with it.\n\nChris Bedi, who was CDIO (chief digital information officer) at ServiceNow, said that things will change in the coming years as employees start demanding access to AI tools. \u201cFrom a talent standpoint, as organizations look to retain talent, which is a hot topic, it doesn\u2019t matter what job function, people want their job talent to stay. I think it\u2019ll be unthinkable to ask your company employees to do their jobs without GenAI,\u201d Bedi told TechCrunch. What\u2019s more, he believes the talent will start demanding it and question why you would want them to do work manually. (Bedi\u2019s title recently changed to chief customer officer.)\n\nTo that end, Bedi says his company is committed to teaching its employees about AI and how to create an AI-literate workforce because people won\u2019t necessarily understand without guidance how to make best use of this technology.\n\n\u201cWe created some learning pathways, so everybody in the company had to take their AI 101,\u201d he said. \u201cWe created that and selectively [levels] 201 and 301 because we know the future is AI, and so we have to get our whole workforce comfortable with it,\u201d he said.\n\nAll of this suggests that while the concerns may be the same as they were in the last wave of technological change, IT executives have perhaps learned some lessons along the way. They understand now that you can\u2019t just lock it down. Instead they have to find ways to help employees use generative AI tools safely and effectively because if they don\u2019t, employees will probably start using them anyway."}
