In a blog post on Monday, Meta said it wants to \u201cmake it easier for educators to discover interactive and engaging content,\u201d spanning subjects such as science, medicine, history, and language arts.\n\nAhead of the program\u2019s formal launch, universities will be tasked with testing VR and mixed reality (XR) prototypes in class, ahead of a more formal launch in the future. The universities include Arizona State University, Houston Community College, Imperial College London, Miami Dade College, Morehouse College, New Mexico State University, San Diego State University, Savannah College of Art & Design, The University of Glasgow, University of Iowa, University of Leeds, University of Miami, and University of Michigan.\n\nMeta also said it\u2019s bringing its \u201cdigital twin\u201d metaversity program to Europe, starting with the University of Leeds in the U.K.; University of the Basque Country in Spain; and the University of Hannover in Germany. This follows more than two years after Meta partnered with a company called VictoryXR to power virtual university programs in the U.S. \u2014 in environments that directly replicate their real-world campus counterparts.\n\nMeta says \u201cimmersive classes\u201d have begun already at the University of Leeds, with an initial focus on performance and theater. The University of Basque Country, meanwhile, will follow suit in February 2025 with classes on physiotherapy and anatomy, while the University of Hannover will offer immersive classes starting in the next academic year.\n\nThe University of Leeds\u2019 \u201cMetaversity.\u201d Image Credits:Meta\n\nVirtual education\n\nToday\u2019s announcement comes some seven months after Meta teased a new education-focused product built around its Quest headsets, including a hub for education apps and tools, and controls to enable administrators to manage multiple headsets centrally. At the time, Meta said it planned to make the product available to \u201cinstitutions serving learners aged 13+\u201d; however, today\u2019s news suggests that \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 it\u2019s focusing on older learners.\n\nHowever, it also shows that Meta is far from giving up on its costly VR endeavors \u2014 Meta\u2019s Reality Labs outfit, focused on all things VR and AR, continues to hemorrhage money. Its most recent earnings showed that while revenue was up 29% year-on-year to $270 million, its expenses were also up, leading to an overall Q3 loss of $4.4 billion, a figure the company expects to keep growing due to \u201congoing product development\u201d and \u201cinvestments to further scale our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
