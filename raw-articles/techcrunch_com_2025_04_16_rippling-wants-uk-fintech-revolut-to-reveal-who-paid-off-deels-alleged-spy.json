He alleged the first $6,000 payment was sent to his Revolut account by Alba Basha Westgarth, the wife of Deel\u2019s COO Dan Westgarth, back in November 2024.\n\nAt the time, Alba Basha Westgarth was working as the crypto compliance lead at Robinhood, according to a LinkedIn profile reviewed by TechCrunch that has since been deleted. Robinhood told TechCrunch that she left Robinhood earlier this year, but did not explain why.\n\nThe deleted LinkedIn profile listed her location as Dubai \u2014 that\u2019s the same place where Deel\u2019s CEO and legal director are now located as Rippling tries to serve them papers. The UAE has a reputation as an extradition haven.\n\nRippling is now suing Revolut to get the full name and address of the \u201cAlba Basha\u201d listed as the sender on that $6,000 receipt, court records show. Rippling is also seeking all account opening documentation \u2014 things like IDs and utility bills \u2014 to definitively confirm her identity.\n\nIn response, Revolut has hired a top lawyer in Ireland. It also sent a letter responding to Rippling last week, which a lawyer for Rippling described as \u201chelpful but complicated\u201d in a court hearing (without elaborating.)\n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s no indication or accusation that Revolut has done anything wrong here. The E.U. has strict privacy laws, so supplying that kind of information isn\u2019t simple, especially in a civil case like this one. A key sticking point is that there hasn\u2019t been an order from the Irish court itself on Revolut to provide the information.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The only other option under European privacy laws would be customer consent, which seems unlikely in this case.\n\nDeel, which has denied all wrongdoing to the media, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Deel COO Dan Westgarth and Alba Basha Westgarth didn\u2019t respond either. Rippling declined to comment.\n\nAlthough the evidence isn\u2019t yet definitive, the Irish High Court gave a clue that it may honor Rippling\u2019s wishes to verify Alba Basha\u2019s identity in some way or form.\n\nAfter a lawyer for Rippling rattled off evidence connecting Alba Basha to Dan Westgarth, including a Facebook photo of the two together, during an April 2 court hearing, Judge Mark Sanfey remarked that \u201cit could be a coincidence, but it\u2019s unlikely!\u201d\n\nYou can send tips securely to this reporter on Signal at +1 628-282-2811.\n\n"}
