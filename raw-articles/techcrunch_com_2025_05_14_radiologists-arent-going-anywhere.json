Fast-forward and the specialists \u2014 who do more than analyze images \u2014 are thriving, observes The New York Times. In fact, the field is experiencing explosive growth amid a looming workforce crisis. (According to projections from the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. will face a staggering shortage of up to 42,000 radiologists and other physician specialists by 2033.)\n\nRather than stealing jobs, notes the piece, AI has become radiologists\u2019 secret weapon, allowing them to instantly measure organs, automatically flag abnormalities, and even detect diseases years before conventional methods. At the Mayo Clinic, where radiologist numbers have skyrocketed by 55% since Hinton\u2019s prediction, the radiology department has grown to include a 40-person team of AI scientists, researchers, analysts, and engineers who have licensed and developed more than 250 AI models, ranging from tissue analyzers to disease predictors.\n\n\u201cFive years from now, it will be malpractice not to use AI,\u201d says John Halamka, president of the Mayo Clinic Platform, who oversees the health system\u2019s digital initiatives, in the article."}
