According to Statista, the number of consumer edge-enabled IoT devices is forecast to grow to almost 6.5 billion by 2030, up from 4 billion in 2020.\n\nCapitalizing on the trends, Memfault, a platform that allows IoT device manufacturers to find issues in their edge products over the cloud, has closed a $24 million Series B funding round led by Stripes, with participation from the 5G Open Innovation Lab, Partech and Uncork. The investment brings Memfault\u2019s total raised to more than $35 million following an $8.5 million cash infusion in April 2021.\n\n\u201cWe sharpened our go-to-market motion in 2022 and saw a clear acceleration in the business,\u201d Memfault co-founder and CEO Fran\u00e7ois Baldassari told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWe feel confident that our playbook for sales-led growth is at a level of maturity where we can double down on our investment and accelerate growth. This was not the case a year ago; there is more talent available on the market than at any time since we started the company.\u201d\n\nBaldassari first conceived of Memfault while at smartwatch startup Pebble, where he worked alongside Memfault\u2019s other two co-founders, Tyler Hoffman and Chris Coleman, for several years. At Pebble, the trio had to investigate hardware issues that were often difficult to fix remotely, which led them to create cloud-based software and performance monitoring infrastructure to improve the process.\n\nAfter leaving Pebble, Baldassari joined Oculus as head of the embedded software team while Hoffman and Coleman took senior engineering roles at Fitbit. The infrastructure they created at Pebble stuck with them, though, and in 2018, the three reunited to found Memfault.\n\n\u201cWe offer the tools to de-risk launch, prepare for the inevitability of post-launch issues and deliver a continuously improving, higher-quality product overall,\u201d Baldassari said. \u201cWe can help companies ship more feature-rich products with continuous feature updates after the devices are in the field while helping companies stay in compliance with environmental, privacy and security regulations and avoid service-level agreement and warranty violations.\u201d\n\nStripping away the marketing fluff, Memfault provides software development kits (SDK) that let manufacturers upload performance data and error reports to a private cloud. There, it\u2019s stored, analyzed and indexed so engineers can access it via a web interface to look for anomalies and troubleshoot problems as they occur.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But he argues that both approaches end up being more expensive and require more technical resources than deploying a service like Memfault.\n\n\u201cYou can never anticipate every use case that a user might subject your device to, and there are some bugs that only surface in one in 10,000 instances. Trying to replicate that is nearly impossible,\u201d Baldassari said. \u201cUsing Memfault, engineers react to issues in minutes rather than weeks, the majority of issues are automatically deduplicated and a clear picture of fleet health can be established at all times.\u201d\n\nWhile cybersecurity isn\u2019t its main focus, Memfault has sometime rivals in startups like Sternum, Armis, Shield-IoT and SecuriThings, whose platforms offer remote tools for monitoring security threats across IoT device fleets. More directly, Memfault competes with Amazon\u2019s AWS IoT Device Management, Microsoft\u2019s Azure IoT Edge, Google\u2019s Cloud IoT and startups like Balena and Zededa, which sell utilities to seed over-the-air updates and perform high-level troubleshooting.\n\nMemfault claims to have a sizeable market foothold regardless, with \u201chundreds\u201d of companies in its customer base including Bose, Logitech, Lyft and Traeger. And it\u2019s not resting on its laurels.\n\nTo stay ahead of the pack, Memfault plans to use the proceeds from its Series B to expand its platform\u2019s software support (it recently announced Android and Linux SDKs) and invest in out-of-the-box integrations, adding to its existing partnerships with semiconductor manufacturers including Infineon, Nordic Semiconductors and NXP. Memfault also intends to expand its headcount, aiming to roughly double in size from 38 people to 80 by the end of the year.\n\nBaldassari said that Memfault is also exploring ways it could build AI into future products, although that work remains in the early stages.\n\n\u201cWe see promise in AI\u2019s ability to help us develop sharper anomaly detection and error classification capabilities,\u201d Baldassari said. \u201cWe\u2019ve accumulated the largest corpus of hardware and firmware errors in the industry and hope to train AI systems on that data in the future.\u201d\n\nAsked about macroeconomic headwinds, Baldassari \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t discuss revenue \u2014 admitted that the pandemic-spurred chip shortage affected Memfault\u2019s customers and market \u201cquite a bit.\u201d But it turned out to be an blessing in disguise.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, customers have been unable to find enough chips to produce the number of devices they planned on. In other cases, they\u2019ve had to switch to new chips they\u2019ve not previously had on their devices,\u201d Baldassari explained. \u201cIn these cases, Memfault has been a huge help to our customers. Many engineers tell us that they aren\u2019t sure what their firmware will look like running on these \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 devices \u2014 but with visibility into fleet data, diagnostics and debugging info from Memfault, they\u2019ve been able to ship confidently.\u201d\n\nBaldassari volunteered that Memfault has maintained \u201chigh\u201d gross margins and a low burn multiple \u2014 \u201cburn multiple\u201d referring to how much the company\u2019s spending in order to generate each incremental dollar of annual recurring revenue. (The lower the multiple, the better.) Of course, it\u2019s all tough to evaluate without firmer numbers. But when pressed, Baldassari stressed that Memfault hasn\u2019t been growing at any cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been focused on building a long-term sustainable business,\u201d Baldassari said. \u201cAlthough there is a broader slowdown in tech, the global trend is going towards more automation. Most customers and prospects have told us how they are willing to spend on software and automation to stay ahead of competition.\u201d"}
