But this also means the space is getting \u2013 and will continue to get \u2013 more crowded.\n\nSo how are the most successful HR tech startups breaking through the noise? And what can startups in any industry learn from them? For answers, I spoke to a dozen founders and marketing leaders at this year\u2019s HR Tech Conference. In our conversations, the following five themes came up over and over.\n\nBe bold: \u201cDifferent is better than better\u201d\n\nGal Fontyn, VP of global marketing at people enablement platform Leapsome, cited Sally Hogshead when asked how to stand out from the crowd: \u201cDifferent is better than better,\u201d he said. He noted that in the HR tech space, \u201ca lot of companies use similar brand visuals and . . . the same kind of jargon that doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one. Jake Sorofman, CMO of people analytics platform Visier, said, \u201cToo often, marketing suffers from compromise, defaulting to directions that are safe, expected, and conventional.\u201d The impact? A dilutive effect on marketing investments.\n\n\u201cYou need to have the courage to get a bit ahead of your skis from time to time,\u201d he added.\n\nOf course, \u201cbe different\u201d is easier said than done. Even an article like this aims to help readers learn from \u2014 and imitate \u2014 what works. Still, that the imperative to differentiate came up so often can serve as validation for marketing leads in need of evidence to support their most exciting ideas.

Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to meet pushy salespeople at Immediate,\u201d said Matt Pierce, founder and CEO of the company, which offers responsible earned wage access as a voluntary benefit. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get someone to sign a contract at a first meeting. We\u2019re trying to build a relationship.\u201d\n\nThis was a theme we heard over and over.\n\nAccording to John Schneider, CMO of intelligent performance management platform Betterworks, the role of HR in enterprises is becoming more strategic. This means that selling effectively requires a less-aggressive approach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about building a relationship, not a transaction,\u201d he said. He also noted that his team tries \u201cto have a conversation with [prospects] on a sustained basis\u201d \u2014 an effort supported in large part by content marketing. \u201cThat creates a relationship where they can trust us and be confident that what we\u2019re telling them is useful and valuable.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to selling to enterprise clients in particular, \u201cbuilding relationships is the most important thing we can do.\u201d That\u2019s from Amy DeCicco, marketing vice president at Retrain.ai, which offers AI-powered talent intelligence. Why? Because enterprise sales cycles are long; to stay in touch with a potential customer for that amount of time, you need to have a relationship with them. And that means you have to intentionally build the relationship.\n\nHow are HR tech marketing leaders doing that? Glad you asked.\n\nOffer value from day one: From surveys and tools to donuts and chargers\n\nRight off the bat, it\u2019s important to note that the starting point for the vendor-prospect relationship is not neutral. The vendor is trying to sell something, and the potential buyer knows that.\n\nAs Richard Mendis, CMO of AI interview analysis platform HireLogic, put it: \u201c[HR buyers] should be skeptical of vendor claims.\u201d It would be silly, in fact, for vendors to pretend otherwise. To overcome that skepticism, he noted, vendors have to charge out of the gate with value \u2014 in HireLogic\u2019s case, a no-cost, no-risk pilot.\n\nSome other examples of how HR tech startups are providing value from the first interaction, including on the trade show floor:\n\nTemplates and frameworks helpful for the work HR professionals are doing (Leapsome).\n\nA sandbox where customers can try the product, plus a 90-day opt-out period when new customers sign (Praisidio).\n\nA public-facing tool that lets prospects test-drive the system (Retrain.ai).\n\nOriginal research that speaks to prospects\u2019 primary pain point (Applaud).\n\nAnd what if your first interaction with prospects isn\u2019t online? That was the case for Liv Anderman, marketing VP of AI talent acquisition and management platform Findem, when I met her at HR Tech. \u201cWe\u2019ve got charging stations, we\u2019ve got lounge spaces for meaningful conversations, we\u2019ve got donuts and cocktails \u2014 instead of swag people won\u2019t get any value from.\u201d And indeed, the Findem booth was a hub of activity every time I went by.\n\nThe \u201cright\u201d offering? Anything that\u2019s genuinely helpful and creates high-quality and meaningful experiences for where a person is in their relationship with a brand. In the early stages, that often means you have to . . .\n\nProvide access to existing customers: \u201cNo one wants to be the guinea pig\u201d\n\nCase studies are table stakes in B2B marketing, and for good reason: They provide social proof.\n\nAmong the marketers we spoke to, though, the standard case study was just a jumping-off point. Take Praisidio founder Ken Klein, who noted that they have \u201ca significant number of successful, referenceable customers who can vouch for the value we provide.\u201d As in, they provide prospects direct access to current customers. That is what a good relationship looks like.\n\nRunae Lee, head of partnerships at Finch, a unified API for employment data, emphasized that they strive for case studies that are at least co-branded and often hosted by a partner or customer. \u201cIt lends additional credence and helps build trust via external validation,\u201d he said.\n\nPerhaps the boldest strategy? Matt Pierce of Immediate says, \u201cWe\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, sit down and speak with some of our customers . . . they\u2019ll tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly. But it\u2019s going to be mostly good!\u2019\u201d Again, think of how strong your relationship has to be for that to work.\n\nAnd when telling customer stories, don\u2019t lose sight of what really matters: Impact. Simon Foley, head of sales and business operations at employee experience platform Welliba, recommended crafting stories so they spotlight the \u201cmeaningful impact\u201d the product had on the customer.\n\nFontyn had a similar take, noting that Leapsome aims to connect the right customer references to the right buyers. \u201cNo one wants to be the guinea pig,\u201d he said.\n\nEducate: \u201cThe literacy for what we do isn\u2019t there yet\u201d\n\nFor some startups, however, case studies aren\u2019t enough to get great-fit customers on board. For those offering products and services that are unfamiliar to their target audiences, education has to be front and center.\n\nAs Lee put it, \u201cThe literacy for what we do isn\u2019t there yet.\u201d So he and the Finch team focus on educating their audiences about how unified APIs can make their lives better as a parallel path to traditional lead gen.\n\nIvan Harding, co-founder and CEO of employee experience platform Applaud, agreed. \u201cWe do a lot of educational content,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd then hopefully [visitors] will follow on to do some discovery around our website.\u201d\n\nThose offering AI-powered tools are acutely feeling the need for prospect education, especially in building trust. DeCicco said Retrain.ai tackles the problem head-on. \u201cWe built a responsible HR forum,\u201d she said. \u201cWe brought together the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] commissioner, regulators, legal academics, and analysts in one room to talk about how responsible AI and responsible HR practices are so important.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the company now has a responsible HR counsel that aims to put out unique research every quarter. This strategy can reap big rewards: Planned right, original research drives both media attention (which boosts credibility and authority) and inbound links (which boost SEO).\n\nTo break through the noise, be human\n\nWe live in an incredibly noisy time. If you\u2019ve read this far, you no doubt had to fend off half a dozen notifications along the way. And that\u2019s true for pretty much everyone alive today (and certainly anyone in the market for HR software).\n\nOver and over, what the most successful marketers in the crowded HR tech space told me was that the top-performing marketing \u201cstrategy\u201d essentially amounts to this: Be human. Understand who you\u2019re selling to. Listen to them. Help them. And keep listening and helping, because what they\u2019re saying and what they need will change. What won\u2019t change is that, when they\u2019re ready for a solution, they\u2019ll turn \u2014 as we all do \u2014 to people they know they can trust."}
