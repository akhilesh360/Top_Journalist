But in the ensuing years, as they experienced economic headwinds, first from the pandemic, and then rising interest rates, it became an imperative.\n\nAs such, Stacklet\u2019s cloud cost control and governance platform has seen a rise in popularity. In fact, CEO Stanfield says that while he can\u2019t get into specific numbers, revenue tripled year over year in 2023. Investors apparently liked what they saw, and made a $14.5 million investment to capitalize on the continued growth.\n\nTechCrunch\u2019s Frederic Lardinois described the company\u2019s core commercial product in a 2021 article, showing that cost control is just one part of the offering:\n\n\u201cStacklet helps enterprises manage their data governance stance across different clouds, accounts, policies and regions, with a focus on security, cost optimization and regulatory compliance. The service offers its users a set of pre-defined policy packs that encode best practices for access to cloud resources, though users can obviously also specify their own rules. In addition, Stacklet offers a number of analytics functions around policy health and resource auditing, as well as a real-time inventory and change management logs for a company\u2019s cloud assets.\u201d\n\nThe company also has a true open source piece called Cloud Custodian. The two founders helped develop the software when they were working at Capital One, before leaving to launch Stacklet. The project was open sourced in 2016, and became part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2019.\n\nSome open source projects have switched to more restrictive licenses in recent years, but Thangavelu says that won\u2019t happen with this one, because it is part of the CNCF forever. As for protecting the commercial product from being cannibalized by the free version, he says there is too much separation between the two for the open source to threaten the company\u2019s core commercial offering.\n\n\u201cThe open source project is a stateless rules engine. It\u2019s just a CLI (command line interface). With our commercial product, we bring a platform to help people accelerate out of the box with context, and give them value and additional capabilities that don\u2019t exist within the open source piece,\u201d he said.\n\nStanfield says they have found that the cost control piece is particularly important to customers, something that wasn\u2019t always the case. In the early days of the company, most folks didn\u2019t have any notion of FinOps, the name given for controlling cloud spending inside organizations. Yet it has become even more important in recent years with the growing popularity of AI, which tends to be resource intensive.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Certainly, given the economic climate that we have been in recent years, we got a lot of really fantastic investors around the table,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nToday\u2019s round was led by SineWave VC with participation from Strait Capital, Uncorrelated Ventures, Capital One Ventures, Foundation Capital and Relentless Ventures. Stacklet has now raised $36.5 million, according to the company."}
