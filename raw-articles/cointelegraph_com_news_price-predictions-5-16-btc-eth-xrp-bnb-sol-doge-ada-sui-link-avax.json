A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.\n\nMarket intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which \u201chistorically is a bullish sign for prices.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nHowever, repeated failure to push the price to the all-time high of $109,588 could tempt short-term buyers to book profits. That puts the $100,000 support at risk of a breakdown. If that happens, Bitcoin could be in for a deeper pullback.\n\nCould buyers drive the price to a new all-time high, pulling select altcoins higher? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nBitcoin bulls are struggling to propel the price above the $105,000 overhead resistance, but a positive sign is that the $100,000 support has held.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($99,416) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone signal that bulls remain in control. If the price closes above $105,000, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to break above the $109,588 resistance. If that happens, the pair could surge to $130,000.\n\nTime is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($90,628).\n\nEther price prediction\n\nEther\u2019s (ETH) pullback is finding support at the breakout level of $2,550, signaling that every minor dip is being purchased.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $2,750, the ETH/USDT pair could resume its up move. There is resistance at $2,860, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair could then climb to $3,000.\n\nThe $2,400 level is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A break below it could sink the pair to the 20-day EMA ($2,225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.\n\nXRP price prediction\n\nXRP (XRP) has reached the resistance line after turning down from the overhead resistance of $2.65 on May 14.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the price dips below the resistance line, it suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. That increases the likelihood of a range-bound action between $2.65 and $2 for a few days.\n\nConversely, a solid bounce off the resistance line signals that the bulls are attempting to flip the level into support. Sellers may pose a solid challenge at $2.65, but if the bulls prevail, the XRP/USDT pair could reach $3.\n\nBNB price prediction\n\nBuyers have successfully defended the $644 level in BNB (BNB), but the failure to start a strong rebound suggests that the bears have kept up the pressure.\n\nBNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThe zone between $644 and the 20-day EMA ($631) is expected to attract buyers. If the price turns up from the support zone, the bulls will strive to kick the price to the overhead resistance at $693.\n\nOn the contrary, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the higher levels are attracting solid selling by the bears. The BNB/USDT pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($604).\n\nSolana price prediction\n\nSolana (SOL) is facing stiff resistance at $180, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($161) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers propel the price above $185, the SOL/USDT pair could resume its uptrend and travel to $210.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($140).\n\nDogecoin price prediction\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is attempting to bounce off the breakout level of $0.21, signaling demand at lower levels.\n\nDOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.20) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that buyers are in command. A break and close above $0.26 indicates the resumption of the up move. The DOGE/USDT pair could then rally to $0.31.\n\nSellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to invalidate the bullish view. The pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($0.17), suggesting a possible range formation in the near term.\n\nCardano price prediction\n\nCardano (ADA) turned down from $0.86 on May 12 and dropped to the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern.\n\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nA strong rebound off the neckline suggests a positive sentiment where the bulls are buying on dips. The bulls will then attempt to shove the price above the $0.86 resistance. If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair could surge to $1.01.\n\nContrarily, a break and close below the neckline suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair could descend to the 50-day SMA ($0.68) and later to the solid support at $0.60.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin breakout odds climb as all-time highs meet $90K dip warning\n\nSui price prediction\n\nSui (SUI) pulled back to the 20-day EMA ($3.62) on May 15, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.\n\nSUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. The buyers will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above the $4.25 resistance. If they can pull it off, the SUI/USDT pair could soar to $5. Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge in the $5 to $5.37 zone.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the pair down to $3.12.\n\nChainlink price prediction\n\nChainlink (LINK) has turned down from the resistance line of the descending channel pattern, implying that the bears are selling on rallies.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nA minor positive is that the bulls have successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($15.56). Buyers will again attempt to thrust the price above the resistance line. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $19.80 and then to $21.30.\n\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price plummets below the neckline. The pair may then drop to the 50-day SMA ($14), which is a crucial support to watch out for. A break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time.\n\nAvalanche price prediction\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) took support at the 20-day EMA ($22.78) on May 15, indicating buying on dips.\n\nAVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA continues to slope up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, signaling an advantage to buyers. The bulls will have to drive the AVAX/USDT pair above $26.84 to open the doors for a rally to $31.73 and subsequently to $36.\n\nSellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, it shows that the markets have rejected the breakout. The pair may slump to the 50-day SMA ($20.57).\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
