She is one of many parents with similar stories who have filed suit against Snap, alleging the company did little to prevent illegal drug sales on the platform before or after her son\u2019s death. She found her son\u2019s dealer posting images advertising hundreds of pills and reported it to Snap, but she says it took the company eight months to flag his account.\n\n\u201cHis drug dealer was selling on Facebook, too,\u201d Mendoza told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected. He was doing the same thing on all those apps, [including] Instagram. He had multiple accounts.\u201d\n\nThe vigil follows recent testimony from whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams, who reveals how Meta targeted 13- to 17-year-olds with ads when they were feeling down or depressed. It also comes four years after The Wall Street Journal published The Facebook Files, which show the company knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls\u2019 mental health despite downplaying the issue in public.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Image Credits:Rebecca Bellan\n\nThursday\u2019s event organizers, which also included advocacy groups ParentsTogether Action and Design It for Us, delivered an open letter addressed to Zuckerberg with more than 10,000 signatures. The letter demands that Meta stop promoting dangerous content to kids (including sexualizing content, racism, hate speech, content promoting disordered eating, and more); prevent sexual predators and other bad actors from using Meta platforms to reach kids; and provide transparent, fast resolutions to kids\u2019 reports of problematic content or interactions.\n\nGardner placed the letter on a pile of rose bouquets that were placed outside Meta\u2019s office on Wanamaker Place as protesters chanted, \u201cBuild a future where children are respected.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, Meta has implemented new safeguards for children and teens across Facebook and Instagram, including working with law enforcement and other tech platforms to prevent child exploitation. Meta recently introduced Teen Accounts to Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, which limits who can contact a teen on the app and restricts the type of content the account holder can view. More recently, Instagram began using AI to find teens lying about their age to bypass safeguards.\n\n\u201cWe know parents are concerned about their teens\u2019 having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online,\u201d Sophie Vogel, a Meta spokesperson, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s why we significantly changed the Instagram experience for teens with Teen Accounts, which were designed to address parents\u2019 top concerns. Teen Accounts have built-in protections that limit who can contact teens and the content they see, and 94% of parents say these are helpful. We\u2019ve also developed safety features to help prevent abuse, like warning teens when they\u2019re chatting to someone in another country, and recently worked with Childhelp to launch a first-of-its kind online safety curriculum, helping middle schoolers recognize potential online harm and know where to go for help.\u201d\n\nGardner says Meta\u2019s actions don\u2019t do enough to plug the gaps in safety.\n\nFor example, Gardner said, despite Meta\u2019s stricter private messaging policies for teens, adults can still approach kids who are not in their network through post comments and ask them to approve their friend request.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had researchers go on and sign on as a 12- or 13-year-old, and within a few minutes, they\u2019re getting really extremist, violent, or sexualized content,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cSo it\u2019s clearly not working, and it\u2019s not nearly enough.\u201d\n\nVogel countered that Teen Accounts are private by default and under 16s can\u2019t change this without a parent\u2019s permission, so adults who aren\u2019t connected to the kid can\u2019t see their comments on posts. She also said that people who sign up with an under 13 date of birth wouldn\u2019t be able to set up an account, so \u201ca researcher would not have been able to set up an Instagram account as a 12-year-old.\u201d\n\nGardner noted that Meta\u2019s recent changes to its fact-checking and content moderation policy in favor of community notes are a signal that the company is \u201cletting go of more responsibility, not leaning in.\u201d\n\nMeta and its army of lobbyists also led the opposition to the Kids Online Safety Act, which failed to make it through Congress at the end of 2024. The bill had been widely expected to pass in the House of Representatives after sailing through a Senate vote, and would have imposed rules on social media to prevent the addiction and mental health harms the sites are widely agreed to cause.\n\n\u201cI think what [Mark Zuckerberg] needs to see, and what the point of today is, is to show that parents are really upset about this, and not just the ones who\u2019ve lost their own kids, but other Americans who are waking up to this reality and thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t want Mark Zuckerberg making decisions about my child\u2019s online safety,\u2019\u201d Gardner said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information from Meta."}
