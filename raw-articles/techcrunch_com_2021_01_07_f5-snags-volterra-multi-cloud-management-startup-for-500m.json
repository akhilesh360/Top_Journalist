That breaks down to $440 million in cash and $60 million in deferred and unvested incentive compensation.\n\nVolterra emerged in 2019 with a $50 million investment from multiple sources, including Khosla Ventures and Mayfield, along with strategic investors like M12 (Microsoft\u2019s venture arm) and Samsung Ventures. As the company described it to me at the time of the funding:\n\nVolterra has innovated a consistent, cloud-native environment that can be deployed across multiple public clouds and edge sites \u2014 a distributed cloud platform. Within this SaaS-based offering, Volterra integrates a broad range of services that have normally been siloed across many point products and network or cloud providers.\n\nThe solution is designed to provide a single way to view security, operations and management components.\n\nF5 president and CEO Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou sees Volterra\u2019s edge solution integrating across its product line. \u201cWith Volterra, we advance our Adaptive Applications vision with an Edge 2.0 platform that solves the complex multi-cloud reality enterprise customers confront. Our platform will create a SaaS solution that solves our customers\u2019 biggest pain points,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Fast forward three years and COVID-19 has dramatically changed the landscape \u2014 it has accelerated digitization of physical experiences and moved more of our day-to-day activities online. This is causing massive spikes in global Internet traffic while creating new attack vectors that impact the security and availability of our increasing set of daily apps,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe sees Volterra\u2019s capabilities fitting in well with the F5 family of products to help solve these issues. While F5 had a quiet 2020 on the M&A front, today\u2019s purchase comes on top of a couple of major acquisitions in 2019, including Shape Security for $1 billion and NGINX for $670 million.\n\nThe deal has been approved by both companies\u2019 boards, and is expected to close before the end of March, subject to regulatory approvals."}
