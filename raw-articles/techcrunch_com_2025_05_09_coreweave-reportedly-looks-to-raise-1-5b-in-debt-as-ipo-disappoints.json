The company\u2019s executives intend to use the meetings to gauge investor interest.\n\nNew Jersey-based CoreWeave listed its shares in March, initially targeting a $2.7 billion fundraise. The company was forced to slash that total to $1.5 billion following investor concern about its large debt burden and a weakening market for AI infrastructure.\n\nCoreWeave, which has customers including Microsoft, raised $12.9 billion of debt in the past two years to build data centers. The company had about $8 billion of total debt on its balance sheet as of December 2024, and is facing debt and interest payments of $7.5 billion by the end of 2026, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nTechCrunch has contacted CoreWeave for comment."}
