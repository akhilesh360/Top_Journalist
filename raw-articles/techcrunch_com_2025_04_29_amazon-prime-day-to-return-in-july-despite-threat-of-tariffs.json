To highlight the impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs, Amazon will reportedly begin to display the cost of the tariffs next to the total price of goods on its site, according to Punchbowl News.\n\nThe White House swiftly blasted Amazon\u2019s decision to display the impact of tariffs as \u201ca hostile and political act by Amazon,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cThis is another reason why Americans should buy American,\u201d she added.\n\nAmazon quickly responded, telling The Washington Post (then publishing the comment on its blog) that listing import charges was something it had only considered for its low-cost Amazon Haul store, not the main site. (Reportedly, Trump had called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain.)\n\nAmazon statement: \u201cThe team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered listing import charges on certain products. This was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties.\u201d \u2014 Jeff Stein (@JStein_WaPo) April 29, 2025\n\nPrime Day is still months away, so it\u2019s unclear to what extent tariffs could impact this year\u2019s sale. Reuters reports that some Amazon sellers have already begun pulling out of Prime Day due to pressure from tariffs, while others are reducing the amount of discounted merchandise they\u2019ll put on sale.\n\nTypically, Prime Day has given Amazon a way to boost sales at an otherwise slower time of the year by offering discounts on both its own products and those from other businesses. The company notes that small and medium-sized businesses today account for more than 60% of sales on Amazon\u2019s store, and last year sold over 200 million items during Prime Day.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Though the company is not teasing any deals yet, it did say that the sale will feature \u201csocially trending items\u201d as well as \u201ccreator favorites,\u201d alongside other Amazon-exclusive products.\n\nThe event is also going to be held in Ireland this year for the first time and will return to a range of other global markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the U.S., and the U.K.\n\nAmazon on Tuesday also launched a new luxury goods selection on its site, curated by Saks.\n\nThis latest addition to Amazon\u2019s Luxury Stores section will feature top brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Balmain, Etro, Stella McCartney, Giambattista Valli, Erdem, Fear of God, Jason Wu Collection, Rosetta Getty, Johanna Ortiz, Chantecaille, and La Prairie.
