The notification advised users to \u201cJust enable your mic and say \u2018Hey Spotify, Play my Favorite Songs.\u201d When tapped, the notification launched Spotify\u2019s new voice interface where users are pushed to first give the app permission to use the microphone in order to be able to verbally request the music they want to hear.\n\nSeveral outlets soon reported the feature had launched to Android users, which is only partially true.\n\nAs it turns out, the feature is making its way to iOS devices, as well. When we launched the Spotify app here on an iPhone running iOS 14.5, for instance, we found the same feature had indeed gone live. You just tap on the microphone button by the search box to get to the voice experience. We asked around and found that other iPhone users on various versions of the iOS operating system also had the feature, including free users, Premium subscribers and Premium Family Plan subscribers.\n\nThe screen that appears suggests in big, bold text that you could be saying \u201cHey Spotify, play\u2026\u201d followed by a random artist\u2019s name. It also presents a big green button at the bottom to turn on \u201cHey Spotify.\u201d\n\nOnce enabled, you can ask for artists, albums, songs and playlists by name, as well as control playback with commands like stop, pause, skip this song, go back and others. Spotify confirms the command with a robotic-sounding male voice by default. (You can swap to a female voice in Settings, if you prefer.)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

There\u2019s a link to Spotify policy regarding its use of voice data, which further explains that Spotify will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you. The company says it may continue to use this data to improve the feature, develop new voice features and target users with relevant advertising. It may also share your information with service providers, like cloud storage providers.\n\nThe policy looks to be the same as the one that was used along with Spotify\u2019s voice-enabled ads, launched last year. Spotify later clarified that the app will always indicate \u2014 with an in-app visual or audio tone \u2014 when it is receiving a user\u2019s voice input. At other times, the app listens for \u201cHey Spotify\u201d in short, few-second snippets that are deleted if you don\u2019t say it, it says. The full voice controls policy is detailed here.\n\nGiven the \u201cHey Spotify\u201d voice command\u2019s origins with \u201cCar Thing,\u201d there\u2019s been speculation that the mobile rollout is a signal that the company is poised to launch its own hardware to the wider public in the near future. There\u2019s already some indication that may be true \u2014 MacRumors recently reported finding references and photos to Car Thing and its various mounts inside the Spotify app\u2019s code. This follows Car Thing\u2019s reveal in FCC filings back in January of this year, which had also stoked rumors that the device was soon to launch.\n\nSpotify was reached for comment on Wednesday morning, but was unable to provide any answers about the feature\u2019s launch despite a full day\u2019s wait. Instead, we were told that they \u201cunfortunately do not have any additional news to share at this time.\u201d That response further suggests some larger projects could be tied to this otherwise more minor feature\u2019s launch. [Update, April 4: Spotify finally confirmed the launch of \u201cHey Spotify\u201d, noting the feature has begun to roll out to iOS and Android users in the U.S. and will continue to roll out to more in the next few weeks.]\n\nThough today\u2019s consumers are wary of tech companies\u2019 data collection methods \u2014 and particularly their use of voice data after all three tech giants confessed to poor practices on this front \u2014 there\u2019s still a use case for voice commands, particularly from an accessibility standpoint and, for drivers, from a safety standpoint.\n\nAnd although you can direct your voice assistant on your phone (or via CarPlay or Android Auto, if available) to play content from Spotify, some may find it useful to be able to speak to Spotify directly \u2014 especially since Apple doesn\u2019t allow Spotify to be set as a default music service. You can only train Siri to launch Spotify as your preferred service.\n\nIf, however, you have second thoughts about using the \u201cHey Spotify\u201d feature after enabling it, you can turn it off under \u201cVoice Interactions\u201d in the app\u2019s settings."}
