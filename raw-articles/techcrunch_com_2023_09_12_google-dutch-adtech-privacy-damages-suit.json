It\u2019s demanding Google stops tracking and profiling consumers and is also seeking compensation for what it dubs \u201clarge-scale privacy violations\u201d of the European Union\u2019s data protection regime.\n\nThe representative action, which has been filed with the Amsterdam District Court, is being brought by two not-for-profits: The Foundation for the Protection of Privacy Interests (FPPI) and the Dutch Consumers\u2019 Association (aka Consumentenbond).\n\nMore than 82,000 consumers have signed up to join the claim since it was announced back in May, per the pair.\n\n\u201cGoogle acts in violation of Dutch and European privacy legislation,\u201d the Google claim plaintiffs argue on their website [translated from Dutch with AI]. \u201cThe tech giant collects users\u2019 online behavior and location data on an immense scale through its services and products. Without providing enough information or having obtained permission.\n\n\u201cGoogle then shares that data, including highly sensitive personal data about health, ethnicity and political preference, for example, with hundreds of parties via its online advertising platform. Irish research shows that residents\u2019 internet activity and locations in Europe are exposed to online ad auctions on average almost 380 times a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle must stop violating your privacy and pay damages. We also demand that Google implement structural changes so that it no longer violates your privacy. Google turns you into a product and collects billions in advertising sales every year,\u201d they add.\n\nThe \u2018no win, no fee\u2019 suit is still open to sign ups \u2014 registration is offered via the claim website. Consumers who have used Google product or services at any time after March 1, 2012, and lived in the Netherlands, can join the mass action.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The new procedural rules have been required to be applied to new claims since June 25.\n\nAdd to that, back in May, a ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU confirmed there is no threshold of seriousness for non-material harm in order to claim compensation for privacy damages. Which means claims can be brought for emotional distress flowing from a violation of the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or other privacy laws.\n\nCommenting on the Google claim in a statement, Ada van der Veer, chairman of the FPPI, added:\n\nGoogle is constantly monitoring everyone. Even when using third-party cookies \u2014 which are invisible \u2014 Google continues to collect data through other people\u2019s websites and apps, even when someone is not using its products or services. This enables Google to monitor almost the entire internet behavior of its users. In addition, Google continuously collects the physical locations of users, even when they are not actively using their devices and think they are \u2018offline\u2019.\n\nA spokesperson for Consumentenbond also told us: \u201cThe case addresses privacy violations from 2012 onwards \u2014 still continuing today. It focuses on specific past and present practices of Google which are in violation of the law.\u201d\n\nGoogle was contacted for comment on the litigation but at press time it had not responded.\n\nA number of aspects of the tech giant\u2019s business have been under investigation by its lead regulator for GDPR, Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission, for several years following complaints its technologies breach EU privacy rules. However no decisions have been handed down \u2014 including on a major complaint against\u2019s Google adtech; another against Google\u2019s location tracking; and several charging Google with deceptive design \u2014 giving consumer rights groups further impetus to resort to litigation so long as funders are willing to take cases on a \u2018no win, no fee\u2019 basis.\n\nIn this case the Google claim is being funded by the litigation-focused law firm, Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein.\n\nResearch into Google\u2019s real-time-bidding adtech by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has previously revealed details of the vast scale of data sharing involved in the high velocity online auctions Google monetizes by matching profiled consumers with microtargeted ads. However, despite the tech giant\u2019s lead regulator for GDPR \u2014 the Irish DPC \u2014 investigating its adtech since 2019 no decision has been issued and, last year, the regulator itself was sued for inaction over the adtech complaint.\n\nIn the meanwhile Google has been busy executing a pivot to an alternative form of ad targeting which aims to shift away from third-party cookies for tracking individual web users\u2019 activity to embedding surveillance technology into its Chrome browser that keeps tabs on the websites consumers visit to assign interest categories that advertisers can use to select which ads they see.\n\nGoogle calls this rebooted ad targeting system \u201cPrivacy Sandbox\u201d. However web users\u2019 activity is still being tracked to determine ad topics for receiving marketing so it\u2019s not clear how much of a privacy advance it represents. Google is also actively pushing the Privacy Sandbox system onto Chrome users \u2014 requiring they take active steps to opt out of it, rather than an affirmative opt in despite its implementation of the migration being closely monitored by U.K. regulators.\n\nThe Consumer Association behind the Google claim previously brought a successful privacy litigation against Facebook-owner Meta, also funded by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein \u2014 obtaining a declaration of rights earlier this year in which the court found the tech giant did not have a lawful basis to process local users\u2019 data for ad targeting.\n\nThis report was updated with additional detail after the Consumentenbond responded to our questions"}
