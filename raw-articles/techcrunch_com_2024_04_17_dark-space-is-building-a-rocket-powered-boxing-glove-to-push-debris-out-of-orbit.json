Much like a Virgin Galactic launch, the aircraft will take the rocket above the tumultuous lower atmosphere, where it can be released and ignited. Once the rocket reaches the vicinity of the target object, the spacecraft detaches and uses onboard sensors and propulsion to find and approach it. When it\u2019s lined up correctly, Interceptor pushes against the object with its cushioned \u201ceffector,\u201d eventually de-orbiting it.\n\n\u201cAll the space sector is organized to do planned, long missions \u2026 but orbital defense is more about unplanned, short missions,\u201d Laheyne said. In that sense, Interceptor \u201cis more like an air defense missile,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt has to be ready all the time. There is no excuse to not be able to use it.\u201d\n\nUnlike an actual missile or anti-satellite weapon, however, the gentle strike of the Interceptor doesn\u2019t produce a debris field or any other dangerous, unpredictable effects.\n\nDark was founded by Laheyne and CTO Guillaume Orvain, engineers who cut their teeth at multi-national missile developer MBDA. This work experience shines through in the Interceptor concept, which is being designed to operate on-call, similar to missile systems. That\u2019s also why Dark is developing its own launching platform: to ensure readiness for defense, civil and commercial companies at a moment\u2019s notice, Laheyne said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The team closed a $6 million extension yesterday, including participation from its first U.S.-based investor, Long Journey Ventures. (That fund is led by Arielle Zuckerberg, the younger sister of Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg.)\n\nThe company has a lot of work ahead before it comes close to removing something like a defunct rocket second stage from orbit. Dark has been focused on developing critical systems, like the cryogenic engine and software. Now the team is shifting its focus to developing the technologies needed for the type of unplanned, quick missions Interceptor will execute, like long-distance detecting and tracking, autonomous flight algorithms, and a system for reliable controlled reentry.\n\nThe team must also retrofit an aircraft \u2014 which Laheyne estimated could cost $50 million, or around the price of building a new launch pad \u2014 and have the entire platform ready for a demonstration mission in 2026.\n\nThat mission would validate many of the core technologies of the full-scale platform, though it won\u2019t actually aim to de-orbit an object, just touch one. Even this is incredibly ambitious: No company has yet cracked so-called rendezvous and proximity operations, meaning moving close to another object in space and interacting with it.\n\nThe second demonstration mission, which is currently planed for 2027, will include a de-orbit attempt. If all goes to plan, the company would start de-orbiting objects for allied civil agencies. As far as defense customers go, \u201chopefully we don\u2019t have to use it,\u201d Laheyne said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing missiles for years, and it\u2019s always the same topic: If you use it first, it\u2019s an act of war. If you\u2019re second, it\u2019s an act of defense. If you can do it, and people know you can do it, it\u2019s dissuasion,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ideal is dissuasion, the system that makes the conflict unthinkable.\u201d"}
