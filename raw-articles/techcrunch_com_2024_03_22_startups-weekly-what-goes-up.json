Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nHelloooo, startup nerds! I spent much of this week in San Jose hanging out in the world of AI startups and tech giants at GTC, and I have a ton of fun stories in the pipeline from there, so stay tuned for all of that. In the meantime \u2026 let\u2019s look at the exciting goodness that has been the past week of TechCrunch startup coverage!\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nLet\u2019s talk about microbiomes\u2026 Image Credits: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty Images Image Credits:Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Microsoft has effectively absorbed Inflection, a once-promising AI startup that raised a staggering $1.3 billion just nine months ago. The acquisition sees Inflection\u2019s co-founders, Mustafa Suleyman and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, along with a significant portion of their team, transitioning to Microsoft to spearhead the newly formed Microsoft AI division. This move leaves Inflection, under the guidance of Reid Hoffman and new CEO Sean White, in a precarious position as it attempts to salvage what remains of its co-founders\u2019 ambitious project. Microsoft\u2019s role in this saga raises eyebrows, as it positions itself as both a savior and an opportunist, capitalizing on the struggles of its investments to consolidate its dominance in the AI space.\n\nMeanwhile, over in the land of biotech, the sector\u2019s latest fascination, the microbiome, has been hailed as a frontier for personalized health solutions, promising to tackle everything from digestive issues to skin conditions. However, a recent report in Science casts a shadow over the burgeoning industry, suggesting that many microbiome companies may be operating with more enthusiasm than scientific rigor. These startups, riding the wave of affordable genome sequencing and venture capital, offer services that profile the unique microbial communities in our bodies to identify health problems and solutions. Yet, the report raises concerns about the lack of meaningful regulation and scientific consensus in this complex field, likening some practices to modern-day snake oil salesmanship. Despite the criticism, companies like Parallel Health, Tiny Health, and Daye defend their approaches, emphasizing their commitment to achieving scientific legitimacy.\n\nInvestors are hungry for AI: Astera Labs\u2019 IPO pops 72% on the first day, showing that investor demand for tech with an AI twist is high.\n\nAstera Labs\u2019 IPO pops 72% on the first day, showing that investor demand for tech with an AI twist is high.

Its new platform offers a seamless experience for purchasing new, open-box, and refurbished devices with cash and through trade-ins, according to the startup\u2019s founder, Bastian Lehmann, who previously founded Postmates.\n\nMost interesting fundraises this week\n\nSneaking in some healthcare through the side door. Image Credits: Getty Images Image Credits:Getty Images\n\nTelegram, the messaging app giant with a user base north of 900 million, just flexed its financial muscles by securing a whopping $330 million through bond sales, as announced by its founder and CEO, Pavel Durov. The bond bonanza was a hit, attracting more cash than they had room for, with Durov boasting about snagging \u201cglobal funds of the highest caliber\u201d under terms that made this the sweetest deal in Telegram\u2019s history. While Durov played coy on who exactly threw their money into the ring, he was clear that these investors are betting big on Telegram\u2019s growth trajectory. The company is aiming for profitability next year, and last raised $220 million worth of funding through bonds about a year ago.\n\nWould you like a side of healthcare with that?: Insurance Tech has had some false starts, but a new hero emerges: \u201cembedded insurance.\u201d This genius idea of sneaking insurance into your shopping cart like an extra pair of socks you didn\u2019t know you needed has given the sector a much-needed face-lift.

Image Credits: Fisker Image Credits:Fisker\n\nIt\u2019s been a week of highs and lows. Where some startups are meeting their demise, others are rising from the ashes, while others again are filling the void left by their falling brethren. All very dramatic.\n\nOne example of this drama is between Google and the EU. The search giant finds itself in hot water once again with France\u2019s Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence, which has slapped the tech giant with a \u20ac250 million fine (around $270 million) for misusing news publishers\u2019 content to train its AI model, Bard/Gemini, without proper notification. This latest fine is part of a longstanding feud over copyright protections, with Google previously attempting to sidestep EU digital copyright reforms by limiting access to its news services in France. The Autorit\u00e9\u2018s investigation revealed that Google not only failed to inform publishers about the use of their content for AI training but also lacked a mechanism for publishers to opt out without affecting their visibility on Google\u2019s other services until late September 2023. Meanwhile, Midjourney thinks it has a plan to beat the copyright cops.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
