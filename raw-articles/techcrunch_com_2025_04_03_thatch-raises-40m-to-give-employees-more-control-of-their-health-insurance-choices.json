In total since its October 2021 inception, Thatch has raised $84.5 million in equity funding.\n\nWhile the San Francisco-based startup declined to reveal its new valuation, co-founder Adam Stevenson told TechCrunch that it was about three times higher than its Series A (Thatch raised $38 million in a Series A round led by General Catalyst in February of 2024).\n\nThatch helps employers offer Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) to employees. ICHRA is a relatively new insurance option, in effect as of 2020.\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference between an ICHRA and HRA? A typical HRA exclusively covers out of pocket medical expenses such as therapy, braces, and prescriptions.\n\nThe ICHRA allows employers to also use the funds to cover individual medical insurance.\n\n\u201cSo imagine each employee gets $1,000 a month \u2014 one employee might buy a Kaiser HMO plan for $800 a month and spend the remaining $200 month on therapy, while another employee might spend $1,000 a month fully on a United PPO plan. Previously, HRAs could not pay for insurance,\u201d CEO and co-founder Chris Ellis explained.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Employees in turn use that budget through Thatch to choose healthcare plans they want, including medical, dental, and vision. If there are leftover funds, they can use that to pay for treatment costs. With Thatch, if an employee grows unhappy with one insurance carrier, they can switch, the founders said.\n\n\u201cWe see about ~50% of members carry a balance left over of around $250 month on average,\u201d Ellis told TechCrunch. Those employees then have the ability to use the extra balance to pay for things that health insurance doesn\u2019t cover, he added.\n\nIn the founders\u2019 view, since the regulation is relatively new, there is plenty of room for innovation. For example, ICHRA employee classes, Stevenson said, allow businesses to customize their health benefits by grouping employees based on factors like hours worked or geographical location. Such flexibility lets employers tailor health plan offerings to different classes.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense for healthcare to be dependent on your employer,\u201d said Stevenson, who serves as the company\u2019s president. \u201cRather than selecting one-size-fits-all benefits for their teams, ICHRA instead allows businesses to give their employees tax-free money to spend on healthcare in the way that works best for them.\u201d\n\nThatch has partnered with QuickBooks so that the company \u201ccan embed and distribute ICHRA directly within\u201d its own product, Ellis said. This means that companies that use QuickBooks can easily set up ICHRA accounts for employees. Thatch is in the process of building a similar offering for ADP, which hasn\u2019t launched yet.\n\nWhile Stevenson declined to reveal revenue figures, he said Thatch has onboarded \u201cover a thousand companies\u201d over the last 18 months and that revenue grew 8x year-over-year. (The company launched its offering in August of 2023). Customers include Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken, Jersey Mike\u2019s, PeopleTech Partners, Fragment.dev, Ferry Health, and Friends of Bonobos.\n\nHealthcare meets fintech\n\nThe two founders\u2019 experience is primarily in healthcare. Ellis started his career as a cancer researcher at MIT. He then founded the U.S. sales team at Sophia Genetics, a clinical software startup, before working on the software product team at Agilent Technologies, a large testing equipment company.\n\nStevenson spent four years at health insurance giant Humana, while launching a few bootstrapped SaaS companies on the side. He eventually landed at Stripe, where he started and led different customer engineering teams for seven years.\n\nThe pair said they came to realize that making ICHRA work would ultimately be tied to solving fintech problems such as managing budgets, issuing funds, remitting and tracking payments, and handling adjudication. So the company worked to recruit employees from companies such as Stripe, Rippling, and Ramp to \u201cto create all of the financial and operational infrastructure necessary to abstract away all of the messiness of ICHRA.\u201d\n\nThatch also has recently hired Gary Daniels, the former CEO for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Pacific Northwest division, as its chief growth officer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s joining because he believes ICHRA is the future of employer-sponsored healthcare,\u201d Stevenson told TechCrunch.\n\nAs of March, Thatch had 72 employees.\n\nJahanvi Sardana, partner at Index Ventures, likened the process of choosing a health plan to \u201ctrying to buy a house without knowing the price or details.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re handed a limited set of options and hope for the best,\u201d she told TechCrunch \u201cThatch makes benefits work like a modern marketplace \u2014 transparent, personalized, and designed around choice. They\u2019re not tweaking the system \u2014 they\u2019re replacing it with something fundamentally better. It\u2019s the kind of shift that, once it happens, will feel obvious in hindsight.\u201d\n\nSardana believes that Thatch isn\u2019t just tackling benefits \u2014 but also a technology and payments problem.\n\nShe said: \u201cEvery piece \u2014 plan selection, payments, reimbursements \u2014 is designed around the end user\u2026That kind of shift doesn\u2019t happen by accident\u2026When the best companies in the world want your product before you even knock on their door, you know you\u2019re building something game-changing.\u201d"}
