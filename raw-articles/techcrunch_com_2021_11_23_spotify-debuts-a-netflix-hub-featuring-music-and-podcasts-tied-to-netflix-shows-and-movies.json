Now, it will be easier to find thanks to an expanded partnership between Netflix and Spotify. The streaming music service today introduced a new \u201cNetflix Hub\u201d on its app, which will offer a centralized place for finding the official soundtracks, playlists and podcasts for top shows and movies on Netflix.\n\nAt launch, the Netflix Hub offers soundtracks and playlists from Stranger Things, La Casa De Papel, Narcos: Mexico, Outer Banks, Squid Game, tick, tick\u2026Boom! Bridgerton, Cowboy Bebop, Virgin River, On My Block and others.\n\nIt will also include Netflix-tied podcasts, like Okay, Now Listen, Netflix Is A Daily Joke,10/10 Would Recommend, You Can\u2019t Make This Up and those that delve into popular shows, like The Crown: The Official Podcast or Behind the Scenes: Shadow and Bone, and more.\n\nOther music and fan experiences will be a part of the new destination as well, including an enhanced album for the Netflix Western film, \u201cThe Harder They Fall,\u201d which offers fans a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the soundtrack led by Jay-Z. In addition, there\u2019s a content destination for \u201cLa Casa De Papel (Money Heist),\u201d Part 5 Volume 2, and a character matching experience where fans get to play a game to find out which \u201cLa Casa De Papel\u201d character they are \u2013which feels a bit like a playing a BuzzFeed quiz.\n\nThe hub builds on Spotify and Netflix\u2019s existing partnership, Spotify tells TechCrunch. The two companies have worked together on many official playlists, including, most recently, the enhanced album for \u201cThe Harder They Fall,\u201d which had been available before the Hub\u2019s debut. They also worked on the \u201cMoney Heist\u201d content experience and the character-matching game ahead of today\u2019s news.\n\nNetflix didn\u2019t purchase access to have a hub on Spotify\u2019s app. In other words, it\u2019s not an ad product, nor did any money exchange hands here. Instead, both companies see the potential in working together to serve their respective fan bases, where there\u2019s naturally a lot of overlap.\n\nNetflix is not the only major company to debut a thematic \u201chub\u201d on Spotify\u2019s app. Recently, Spotify and Peleton announced a similar partnership that introduced a \u201cCurated by Peloton\u201d Workout Hub featuring playlists from Peloton instructors. And outside its app, Spotify earlier this year partnered with GIPHY to introduce users to music via artists\u2019 GIFs.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Spotify, at least as of yet, hasn\u2019t expanded into Netflix\u2019s core market, which makes them better suited as partners.\n\nSpotify says that it plans to roll out more exclusive content to the Netflix Hub in the months ahead.\n\nThe Netflix Hub will available to all users, both Free and Premium, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland and India."}
