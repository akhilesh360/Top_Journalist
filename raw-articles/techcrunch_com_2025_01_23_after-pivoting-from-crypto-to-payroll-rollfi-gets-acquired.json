Rollfi had raised $3.25 million before its exit. Speaking to TechCrunch, Perumalsamy said that the company was in the middle of a fundraise when the opportunity to sell came about.\n\n\u201cWe realized we would be much more successful at winning this market if we can combine the focus, speed, and obsession of a startup with the institutional strength of one of Priority.\u201d\n\nHe said the whole team will remain at PTV after the transaction and will remain an independent entity under Priority.\n\nThis piece was updated to clarify what PTH does and what Rollfi did."}
