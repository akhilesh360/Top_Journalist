We mess up the Earth by throwing out about 4.5 pounds of garbage per person on average every day. Two-thirds of that waste could be composted, but isn\u2019t. And half of the rest of it could be recycled, according to research from the Duke Nicholas School of the Environment, corroborated by studies from the Global Footprint Network and others.\n\nNow, the city of Santa Fe wants to do something about it. Santa Fe has enlisted tech startup Rubicon Global to figure out what its residents toss in the trash, recycle or send to compost. Using data gathered by garbage collectors and trucks on their normal routes, Rubicon helps municipalities quantify their trash and pinpoint neighborhoods for improvement when they clearly need more education or different waste management services.\n\nFunded by Nima Capital and a number of high-profile angel investors, including actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, Rubicon Global first generated buzz as the \u201cUber of garbage.\u201d It promised to make garbage pick-ups available on demand, not just at pre-scheduled times.\n\nIn its early days, Rubicon generated revenue by helping businesses like restaurant chains or hospitals divert waste from landfills and instead send it to be recycled or used elsewhere. Doing that, businesses avoid \u201ctipping fees\u201d charged by landfills. They also get to ballyhoo their efforts in sustainability for positive PR.\n\nRubicon\u2019s long-term goal in Santa Fe is to enable garbage hauling on demand, or just when and where it\u2019s needed. But before making any changes to the way it hauls waste, the city wants to get a handle on its own hot mess. Head of public policy at Rubicon, Michael Allegretti, said the company\u2019s app asks garbage collectors to submit notes about anything unusual on a given job.\n\nIf a collector can\u2019t complete a weekly pick-up because there\u2019s simply no garbage at an abandoned and boarded-up house, the city learns where flight and blight are happening. If they pick up a trash bin that\u2019s full of recyclable bottles and cans, repeatedly, at the same address, the city can target that home for educational outreach on recycling.\n\n\u201cCities want to be smart. They want all the data they can get before they make decisions to spend time and money on programs with a constrained budget. We give them the tools to turn their existing assets into the brains of the smart city,\u201d Allegretti said. Its expansion into Santa Fe marks the first time Rubicon Global has struck a municipal-level contract outside of its hometown of Atlanta, CEO Nate Morris said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The cameras and mobile devices that are already on-board these vehicles do such a good job of gathering data with humans at the wheel that Rubicon hasn\u2019t needed to automate further. However, he noted that Rubicon will always investigate emerging technologies that can help waste management workers do their jobs more efficiently and with less risk."}
