Even people outside the tech world wondered if we would soon start to socialize via virtual reality headsets. But at least according to public opinion and the stock market, the metaverse proved itself to be pretty mid.\n\nPropelled by founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s ardent vision, Meta remains committed to its dreams of a world where we attend work meetings in VR and hang out with our friends in Horizon Worlds, rather than in person. So, as Mark Zuckerberg announced the Quest 3 headset today at the Meta Connect event, it was a surprise that he didn\u2019t mention the metaverse.\n\nNo, really. Zuckerberg did not utter the word \u201cmetaverse\u201d until 33 minutes into his Meta Connect presentation. He played a text adventure game with a Snoop Dogg\u2013inspired AI before he mentioned the metaverse. He used AI to turn his dog into origami before he mentioned the metaverse. He made numerous references to his interest in cage fighting before he mentioned the metaverse. We don\u2019t know how much Mark took away from his Meta Connect rehearsals \u2014 he seemed a little nervous onstage \u2014 but we can guess that someone told him sternly that he cannot talk about the metaverse. The bullying would be endless.\n\nWhen did the metaverse actually come up? After demoing a new slate of AI assistants with specific personalities (which, for some reason, are depicted as celebrities like Naomi Osaka and Charli D\u2019Amelio), Zuckerberg let us know that we will be able talk with these AIs across platforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working on bringing all of this to the metaverse . . . where these AIs will be embodied as avatars, you\u2019ll be able to make them as NPCs in the different games and experiences that you build in all of the different Horizon Worlds, and I think that\u2019s gonna be really neat,\u201d Zuckerberg said at Meta Connect today.\n\nThis pivot in messaging isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 and it\u2019s smart, given how Meta managed to make virtual reality, an inherently cool technology, extremely uncool. This marketing shift has been foreshadowed in Meta\u2019s last several quarterly earnings calls, where Zuckerberg has emphasized Meta\u2019s strides in AI, while VR takes a back seat. He even had to clarify that he still is committed to the metaverse.\n\n\u201cA narrative has developed that we\u2019re somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision, so I just want to say up front that that\u2019s not accurate,\u201d Zuckerberg said on an earnings call in April. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on AI and the metaverse, and we will continue to.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Last quarter, Meta\u2019s VR and AR products brought in just $276 million, while Reality Labs lost $3.7 billion."}
