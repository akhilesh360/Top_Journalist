It was there that he met Dr. Chase Beisel and Rodolphe Barrangou, whose research into Cas3 proteins would eventually be productized by Locus.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company is on target to begin its first clinical trials in the third quarter of the year.\n\nThe focus on bacterial infection and removing harmful bacteria while ensuring that the rest of a patient\u2019s microbiome is intact is a huge step forward for treating diseases that scientists believe could be linked to bacterial health in a body, according to Garofolo.\n\n\u201cMost microbiome companies are about adding probiotics to your body,\u201d says Garofolo, representing a thesis that introducing \u201cgood\u201d bacteria to the body can offset any harmful pathogens that have infected it.\n\n\u201cThings you\u2019re exposed to are creating the groundwork for an infection or disease, or exacerbating an existing disease,\u201d says Garofolo. And while he believes that the microbiome is the next big field for scientific discovery, the approach of adding probiotics to a system seems less targeted and effective to him.\n\nAlready, Garofolo has managed to convince investors of his approach. In addition to the initial outside investment from the North Carolina Biotech Center, Locus has attracted $25 million in financing from investors, including Artis Ventures and the venture capital arm of the Chinese internet giant, Tencent.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have spent millions backing alternative approaches to improving human health through the manipulation of the microbiome.\n\nCompanies like Second Genome, Viome and Ubiome are all using approaches that identify bacteria in the human body and try to regulate the production of that bacteria through diet and probiotic pills. It\u2019s an approach that allows these companies to skirt the more stringent requirements the Food and Drug Administration has put in place for drugs.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that extensive amounts of research haven\u2019t gone into the development of these probiotics. Seed, a Los Angeles-based startup that launched last year, has recruited as its chief scientist George Reid, the leading scientist on microbial health and the microbiome.\n\nFounded by Raja Dhir, a graduate from the University of Southern California and a leading researcher on microbiotics in his own right, and Ara Katz, the former chief marketing officer of BeachMint and an MIT Media Lab fellow, Seed focuses on developing probiotic treatments using well-established research.\n\n\u201cFoundational to our approach is that it\u2019s not which microbes are present in your gut\u2026 It\u2019s based on looking at what specific microbes can do to a healthy individual to improve that status of health independent of what is already present,\u201d Dhir said in an interview around the company\u2019s launch last June. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit less exciting from a tech perspective, but it\u2019s hardcore grounded in basic science\u2026 The question is, does this have changes and effects in validated bio-makers in a controlled and placebo setting?\u201d\n\nDhir said that a basic understanding of how different bacteria can influence health is necessary before getting into the benefits of personalization.\n\n\u201cThese things can dance between drugs and nutrition,\u201d Dhir said. \u201cProbacteria are an additional lever that people should pull\u2026 like diet and exercise and cessation of smoking\u2026 In every correspondence we always have been and need to be clear that this should never be seen as a replacement of therapies.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the tools that Locus is developing are very much therapies with potentially far-reaching implications for illnesses, from irritable bowel syndrome to gastrointestinal cancers and even neurological disorders.\n\n\u201cThe science [around the microbiome] is early, but it is very well-known that a potentially deadly pathogen should be removed from your body,\u201d Garofolo said."}
