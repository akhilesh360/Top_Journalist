Or it might be a phlebotomist, ready to do your blood work in the comfort of your living room.\n\nThat roving phlebotomist is the heart of Getlabs, a startup which just closed a $20 million Series A, following a seed round announced less than a year ago.\n\nFounded in 2018, Getlabs aims to become the boots-on-the-ground accompaniment to telehealth. For example: Imagine you\u2019ve just had a telehealth visit, and your healthcare provider thinks it might be time for a blood test. Instead of trekking to a clinic, Getlabs will come to your home and get the draw done, for an out of pocket \u201cconvenience fee\u201d (to use company parlance) starting at $25.\n\nAt the moment, the company collects samples and works with Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics and Sonora Quest to process those tests.\n\nWe covered Getlab\u2019s origin story in detail here. But in short, the company is informed by founder Kyle Michelson\u2019s own experience. While working on streamup (a music video streaming app) at Y Combinator 2016, he found himself struggling to fit in his medical appointments. At the time, he says, he was struggling with a health condition that required regular lab work.\n\nAlthough telehealth platforms had proliferated, there wasn\u2019t a company that actually offered the in-person services he required. Getlab\u2019s thesis is that the next iteration of direct-to-consumer healthcare will tackle more clinically complex conditions \u2014 the kind that might require regular blood work, or lab tests to confirm diagnoses.\n\n\u201cSome of the existing telehealth companies are more focused on these conditions that don\u2019t require hands-on care,\u201d Michelson told TechCrunch. \u201cThere\u2019s a new breed of telehealth companies that are built from the ground up looking for a way to reach patients physically.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

One commonly cited statistic is that some 70% of clinical decisions are based on lab work. Some scientists have pointed out that no one can really find the origin of that number, but it\u2019s been echoed from the Mayo Clinic to CDC website.\n\nIn the U.S., there are about 14 billion lab tests ordered every year, per the CDC. And there\u2019s evidence that more lab tests are being ordered each year. Between 2013 and 2018, spending on U.S. laboratory tests has increased more than 15%, per a 2020 paper in Implementation Science \u2014 a trend largely driven by healthcare providers ordering more tests. The same trend exists elsewhere, like the U.K. In the early 2000s, the average U.K. citizen got between one and two lab tests done per year; in 2018, the average citizen got five.\n\nImportantly, more lab testing doesn\u2019t always mean better lab testing, but the point is that these tests are becoming more commonplace. But with the increasing use of lab tests, and the expansion of telehealth services happening in tandem, there could be a gap for Getlabs to fill.\n\nTelehealth use has stabilized around 38 times its pre-pandemic level, but in general, telehealth visits tend to result in fewer test orders than in-person visits. This, however, could change as telehealth\u2019s purview expands from urgent care and teletherapy into other areas that rely more heavily on testing.\n\nSome telehealth companies, like Amwell, are beginning to realize that hybrid care models will facilitate telehealth\u2019s bleed into areas like chronic care management, for example. It\u2019s not just Amwell. There has also been investor speculation that the future of telehealth isn\u2019t virtual only, but a hybrid model that combines virtual appointments with in-home remote patient monitoring, or visits from trained specialists.\n\nSince their seed round, Getlabs has invested in building out its phlebotomist workforce to act as the in-person part of a hybrid care model. So far, the company has employed over 100 phlebotomists as W-2 employees. The company has a turnover rate of less than .5%, Michelson noted.\n\nWith that workforce, Michelson says the company has phlebotomists ready to serve about 45% of the U.S. population, up from about 6% just four months ago. The company aims to reach 60% coverage by the end of this year. One thing to note, though, is that this concentration of phlebotomists tends to be relatively urban-centric. (I typed in a few rural addresses in upstate New York as a test case, and Getlabs hadn\u2019t reached the area. But there were a plethora of appointments available if I wanted a lab done in Brooklyn).\n\nMichelson says the workforce largely caters to a suburban audience, rather than a rural or a truly urban one. \u201cWhere we think we actually have the most value is in situations where it\u2019s a patient who lives in the suburbs. You know, they\u2019ve got kids that they have to raise, they\u2019ve got other situations that make it less convenient for them to go [to a clinic],\u201d he said.\n\nDepending on the telehealth company, that focus might dictate whether the two company\u2019s goals truly align. Telehealth is an especially powerful intervention for rural areas that lack access to specialists or clinics in the first place. So getting boots on the ground in those areas too, will prove especially important to help serve those communities.\n\nUltimately, Getlabs falls into the category of companies that are treating healthcare more and more like a consumer product, rather than a piece of bureaucratic drudgery. If they\u2019re in your area, it\u2019s pretty easy to book an appointment using the front-end of their platform. But they\u2019re also interested in the back-end of consumer-facing healthcare as well.\n\nRather than having patients book lab visits themselves, Getlabs is aiming to become fully integrated into a telehealth platform by launching its API. That API, he says, would allow for companies to schedule lab tests directly after patients\u2019 virtual sessions.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is get a verbal response, yes or no. And everything else is done seamlessly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe round was led by Emerson Collective and the Minderoo Foundation. It includes participation from Tusk Venture Partners, Labcorp, Healthworx, Byers Capital, Anne Wojcicki (co-founder and CEO of 23andMe), Susan Wojcicki (CEO of YouTube), Eric Kinariwala (founder and CEO of Capsule), and Mattieu Gamache-Asselin (founder of Alto Pharmacy).\n\nThe major goal of this round, says Michelson, is to increase the amount of healthcare workers hired by the platform. This funding will allow the company to bring on more phlebotomists to expand coverage, and pursue more partnerships with emerging telehealth companies looking for an in-person component."}
