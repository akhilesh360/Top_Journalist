Heading into a long weekend here in the United States, you might think that the news is slowing down but, nope. It\u2019s not. So we have major crypto-football news, European startup analysis, and even some notes on platform dynamics. It\u2019s a busy day, so let\u2019s dive in! \u2013 Alex\n\nThe TechCrunch Top 3\n\nFree money is popular : Alternatively, advertising works. TechCrunch reports that data indicates that the crypto trading ad push during the big American football game led to a spike in downloads for the pertinent companies. Surprised? We\u2019re not, as some of the ads had giveaways attached. Still, a bunch of new folks just got into the crypto game \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to see more in Q1 earnings.\n\n: Alternatively, advertising works.

Europe\u2019s deep tech boom : Diving more deeply into the 2021 startup boom is proving to be good fun, especially as we dial in our focus on key cohorts. Today TechCrunch dug into Europe and the deep tech market, a particular segment of the tech landscape that is often pitched as a U.S.-versus-China battle but could have a third hub, or series of hubs, in the mix.\n\n: Diving more deeply into the 2021 startup boom is proving to be good fun, especially as we dial in our focus on key cohorts.

See, not all SPACs are falling apart: The deal to take crypto-focused startup Circle public via a SPAC has dissolved. But wait! It has also been reforged at a far higher price. It\u2019s rare these days to hear positive SPAC news, so the Circle update caught our attention. Read on for more, but stablecoins are proving to be a lucrative way to accrete reserves, it appears.\n\nStartups/VC\n\nBefore we dive into the day\u2019s startup news digest, a bunch of academics wrote an op-ed for TechCrunch about Spotify, platform dynamics and clarity. It\u2019s worth your time if you are building something that will depend on third-party content, and doubly so if you plan on blending first- and third-party material.\n\nNow, the news:\n\nStill want more? How about Dealshare\u2019s $45 million round led by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, or the fact that Thrive Capital just closed an eighth fund worth $3 billion?\n\n3 keys that unlock data-driven fundraising\n\nIt\u2019s an opportune moment to launch a new company, but rising interest rates, inflation and any other number of unknown factors could lead investors to become more judicious when it comes to placing bets.\n\nData-driven founders who can tell a sweet story with the right metrics are much more likely to get an investor\u2019s attention, according to Blair Silverberg, co-founder and CEO of Hum Capital.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

No, you can\u2019t play Doom on your bike \u2013 not officially, though we suspect that someone, somewhere has done this already \u2013 but the bike shop has built an interactive title to spice up your cycling. I am already in tears in anticipation of it kicking my butt.\n\n: The at-home exercise company is getting into games.

Making them requires mining all sorts of yucky stuff from the planet, and when that material is used, it needs to be disposed of safely. That\u2019s what Redwood wants to work on, and it just landed some key partners.\n\n: Electric cars are very cool and mostly good but not entirely.
