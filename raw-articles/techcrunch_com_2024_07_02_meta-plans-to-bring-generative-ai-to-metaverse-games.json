In parallel, the company aims to build \u2014 or partner with third-party creators and vendors \u2014 generative AI-powered tools that could \u201cimprove workflow and time-to-market\u201d for games.\n\nThe focus will be Horizon, Meta\u2019s family of metaverse games, apps and creation resources. But it might expand to games and experiences on \u201cnon-Meta\u201d platforms like smartphones and PCs.\n\n\u201cThis is a nascent area but has the potential to create new experiences that are not even possible to exist today,\u201d the job listing reads. \u201cThe innovation in this space could have a dramatic effect on the ecosystem as it should increase efficiency and allow considerably more content to be created.\u201d\n\nMeta didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe new efforts come as a blockbuster product remains elusive for Meta\u2019s Reality Labs, the division responsible for the company\u2019s sundry metaverse projects, including its Meta Quest headset. While Meta has sold tens of millions of Quest units, it\u2019s struggled to attract users to its Horizon mixed reality platform \u2014 and claw back from billions of dollars in operating losses.\n\nMeta recently pivoted its metaverse platform strategy, allowing third-party headset manufacturers to license some of the Quest\u2019s software-based features, like hand and body tracking. At the same time, Meta has ramped up investments in metaverse game projects \u2014 reportedly as a product of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s newfound personal interest in developing gaming for Quest headsets.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

A number of platforms now offer tools to generate game art assets and character voices via AI \u2014 to the chagrin of some game creators who fear for their livelihoods.\n\nMeta earlier this year said that it planned to spend billions on generative AI and formed a new top-level team focused on generative AI products like AI characters and ads. In April, Zuckerberg warned that it\u2019ll take \u201cyears\u201d for the company to make money from generative AI \u2014 suggesting that the investments won\u2019t turn Reality Labs\u2019 fortunes around anytime soon."}
