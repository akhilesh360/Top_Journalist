Once it arrived on the space station, the team, which was led by AWS\u2019s Daryl Shuck, connected it, uploaded an ML model for object detection to it and ran it throughout the time of the Axiom mission.\n\nThe astronauts on the Axiom mission performed a total of 25 experiments \u2014 including the Snowball experiment. As Crosier noted, they had to take pictures and document all of the equipment they brought on board and then transported down with them. The object detection model on the Snowcone helped them catalog all of these items (and flag those that were to be excluded from public distribution).\n\nCrosier admitted that this was a relatively simple demonstration but going through the certification process taught the company a lot and also set the stage for future missions. \u201cThat was the demo that we did in orbit, but the whole process, as we think about the future requirements for cloud computing in space, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really excited about because we think it ushers in a whole new era in space innovation \u2014 when you can now, for the first time ever, bring edge computing capabilities onto orbit,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what this is really about. Because the goal here isn\u2019t so much taking existing Snowcones or its larger brethren into space, but taking what the teams learns from these missions (and Amazon is already working with Axiom on future missions) and then maybe integrate more sophisticated edge computing capabilities into satellites, too. What exactly that\u2019ll look like remains to be seen. As any Amazon exec who has gone through the company\u2019s media training will tell you in every interview, the company listens to its customers and works from there.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And so if customers see the value and need for putting [edge] computing capabilities on satellites, you can rightly expect that we\u2019re listening to that and we\u2019re figuring out how we can meet their needs.\u201d\n\nAlready, Amazon and AWS are working with Blue Origin to provide the computing capabilities of its commercial Orbital Reef space station."}
