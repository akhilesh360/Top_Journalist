Using these tools, a startup out of Munich called Beyond Presence believes it holds the keys to what is coming next: Hyper-realistic avatars that look and sound exactly like their human counterparts and can be used in real-time, conversational situations.\n\nThe startup today said it raised its first outside funding, a pre-seed round of $3.1 million. German firm HV Capital is leading the round, with 10x Founders, Alba VC, and individuals from Meta, DeepMind, and Zalando also participating.\n\nBeyond Presence hasn\u2019t actually released its technology into the world just yet, but it is close, Awais Shafique, the startup\u2019s CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch.\n\nPart of the new capital will be used to continue developing the company\u2019s foundational models, he said, and some will fund the release of its public beta by the end of this month.\n\nSo far, some 300 companies are on the waitlist for the product, which will likely have early applications in areas like customer service and support, recruitment, sales, and e-learning. All of these are areas in which companies are looking to scale up interactions with users without having to hire and train more people.\n\nSo, how has a startup managed to raise a multimillion-dollar round even before it\u2019s launched a product, and come this far as a resource-intensive AI company without any outside funding? The answer lies in the founders\u2019 backgrounds.\n\nShafique previously co-founded Presize, a computer vision startup that could accurately take a user\u2019s measurements by recording a clip of the user turning around once in front of a smartphone camera. Those measurements could then be used to help buy apparel online. The Munich-based startup had an outsized profile in its home country because the founders participated in the German TV version of \u201cDragons Den\u201d/\u201cShark Tank\u201d in 2020, where they raised a record-breaking \u20ac650,000.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The price and exact date of the transaction were never disclosed, but some strong signals point to a great exit.\n\nSEC filings show that Meta spent between $774 million from January to March 2022, and $1.15 billion in the first six months of 2022, on acquisitions. Presize was the only deal publicly disclosed at that time. Wikipedia\u2019s list of Meta acquisitions, meanwhile, has been edited with a much more modest estimate: $100 million.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that a deal value in the lower nine figures was more accurate than 10 figures in this case.\n\nRegardless of where Presize fell in that range, given that the startup had only raised \u201ca couple of million,\u201d in Shafique\u2019s estimate, he and his co-founders exited very well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucrative enough that we don\u2019t have to work,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n(They\u2019re all still working anyway. In addition to Shafique\u2019s latest startup, Presize\u2019s other co-founders, Leon Szeli and Tomislav Tomov, are still at Meta, working on its generative AI projects. They remain in contact with Shafique, though, as both are investing in Beyond Presence.)\n\nAt its heart, Presize was aiming to solve a thorny computer vision problem, and that is what Beyond Presence is aiming to do as well.\n\nAdmittedly, my initial thoughts about Beyond Presence\u2019s pitch were skeptical.\n\nDigital avatars are not exactly uncharted territory. Not only have they been around for decades, but they have been getting a boost of attention more recently \u2014 and maybe some hype \u2014 with the latest innovations in AI and processing, not to mention the craze for all things chatbot.\n\nThere are also no clear ideas of what will work in the realm of avatars as a long-term business. Some, like Hyper and Ready Player Me (backed respectively by Amazon and a16z), are drawing from gaming culture and the theory that avatars should not be realistic versions of the people using them. Those who want to hide their identities to preserve their privacy might opt for these approaches over those that replicate their exact likeness.\n\nOthers, like Synthesia, can create likenesses of people, alongside tech that also uses everyday devices like phone cameras to capture your expressions to power avatars that do not look like you. However, these (at least for now) cannot be used for real-time, live interactions.\n\nOthers building tools that you can interact with using everyday devices include Veed and Deepbrain.\n\nBeyond Presence is aiming for not only an avatar that can be created on-the-fly using your phone, but one that looks like you and can be used in real-time, unscripted conversational situations. Something like a video version of the text-based chatbots offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta and many others.\n\nThe startup is not the only one in this space, of course. Zoom appears to be working on hyper-realistic custom avatars, and CommonGround is also developing something along similar lines.\n\nFor now, Beyond Presence is focusing on building something unique in the video component of its product.\n\nEleven Labs is powering the voice part of the experience, and OpenAI\u2019s GPT is the generative AI model powering the content. Business customers can flexibly change which model they use.\n\n\u201cYou can also leave everything up to us, [or use] any LLM that you would like, or any voice agent that you would like. And then we do the face on top of it,\u201d he said. This feature addresses the fact that enterprise customers might already be working with particular LLM providers, for example, or do not want to share any proprietary data externally, he noted.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting detail about Beyond Presence\u2019s early decisions around funding: It turns out that the company was accepted to participate in Y Combinator earlier this year, but opted out of the prestigious incubator.\n\nAlthough YC definitely gives access to great networks, Shafique and his co-founder Felix Altenberger (CTO; and a former deep learning specialist at Presize) chose not to give up equity and autonomy to access that.\n\nWhile YC partners might have had their own input on how to grow the company with sales, Shafique said he and Altenberger had a \u201chorizontal\u201d approach they wanted to pursue.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to move more on the core technology and foundation model layer,\u201d he said.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!
