For example, to this day, patients go into a $1 million MRI machine and \u2014 generally speaking \u2014 walk out with a CD disk with an image of their knee or some other part of their body. It\u2019s just one example of how data can be siloed and how patients are usually locked into large, centralized systems. This means medical professionals can\u2019t easily collaborate with specialists outside of their hospitals.\n\nEstablished corporates selling these centralized systems include BoxDICOM and Ambra Health, and amongst the startups there is EnvoyAI and Collective Minds Radiology (which raised $6.7 million), among others.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

SkinVision reached 1.2 million downloads and raised a total of $15 million in total. Medicai co-founder Alexandru Artimon (CTO) previously co-founded software company Atta Systems.\n\nPopa told me via email: \u201cOne lesson we\u2019ve learned lately about healthcare is that we desperately need flexibility. With the Tumor Board project we\u2019ve shown that Medicai can set up infrastructure in a matter of days to provide access to expertise across 2 continents: US & Canada to Romania and Moldavia \u2013 and this was done in less than ideal conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the Tumor Board project we were able to touch the lives of oncological patients that would have had no other option in seeking treatment and we\u2019re really proud to be a part of that,\u201d he added.\n\nSo far Medicai says it has reached 29 paying clinics/hospitals, with 2,434 doctors accounts and 1,400 patients accounts. It\u2019s also claimed a strategic partnership with Microsoft and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nInvestors to date include D Moonshots, Cleverage Venture Capital, Roca X and Gapminder VC.\n\nMeanwhile the Tumor Board project continues. If there are the predicted four million Ukrainian refugees arriving in the coming months, there could be between 13,000 and 16,000 new patients with cancer per month arriving in countries bordering Ukraine."}
