Despite that shortfall, marquee dates saw standout performances: Black Friday transactions increased 5% to a record $74.4 billion, while Cyber Monday sales grew 3% to $49.7 billion. And Thanksgiving generated $33.6 billion in sales globally, up 6%.\n\nThere is another current that could undercut these numbers though: a higher-than-normal rate of returns. Salesforce said that consumers have already recouped $122 billion from merchandize returned to retailers. That\u2019s up by 28% on last year, a figure that could eventually rise to $133 billion, according to the report.\n\nThis is \u201ca cause for concern,\u201d Salesforce director of consumer insights Caila Schwartz says, though she adds that other forces could help offset those drags. Indeed, Salesforce is one of many in the market building AI solutions for retailers \u2014 the pitch being that AI investments retailers make will lead to lower operational costs, and more personalized and engaging sales channels for customers. Salesforce says that AI and agents \u201cinfluenced\u201d holiday spending to the tune of $229 billion through targeted offers, personalized support, and product recommendations, up 6% year-on-year. AI-powered customer service uptake, specifically, rose 42%.\n\n\u201cRetailers who have embraced AI and agents are already seeing the benefits, but these tools will be even more critical in the new year, as retailers aim to minimize revenue losses on returns and reengage with shoppers,\u201d Schwartz said."}
