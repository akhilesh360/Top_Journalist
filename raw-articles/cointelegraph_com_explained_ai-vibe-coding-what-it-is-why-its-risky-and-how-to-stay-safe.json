This contrasts with traditional software development practices, which require the user to be skilled in programming languages and incorporate formal reviews along the journey.\n\nNotably, Charlie Shrem, an early Bitcoin pioneer, is bringing back the Bitcoin faucet \u2014 a site where people earn small amounts of Bitcoin by solving CAPTCHAs. His new site, 21million.com, is inspired by a 2010 version that helped spread Bitcoin in its early days.\n\nRight now, the site isn\u2019t fully working and has no Bitcoin (BTC) to claim, but Shrem says it\u2019s meant to help new users get started, with no hidden catch. He\u2019s building it using AI tools, calling it \u201cvibe coding.\u201d Shrem, who once ran a major Bitcoin exchange, hopes this project will spark fresh interest in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile AI vibe coding can lead to faster software development results, there is a risk that the output generated from a vibe coding approach may not be adequately reviewed and signed off, which is where traditional coding practices continue to offer safeguards.\n\nDid you know? The term \u201cvibe coding\u201d was popularized by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who described it as a way to \u201cfully give in to the vibes,\u201d effectively embracing AI-generated code without manually tweaking it."}
