The startup\u2019s inaugural product, Monocle, is an open source, pocket-sized AR lens that can be clipped on any eyewear or held to the eye, Launched in March, Monocle has a much more accessible price tag of $349.\n\n\u201cOther AR and VR headsets tend to keep you around your couch at home. We are running in the exact opposite direction,\u201d said Bobak Tavangar, CEO and co-founder of Brilliant Labs, in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nTo integrate its AR device into people\u2019s daily life, Singapore-based Brilliant Labs aims to embed generative AI into its compact wearable. It\u2019s raised some money to pursue this vision. Today, the startup announced its $3 million seed funding led by Brendan Iribe, co-founder of Oculus; Adam Cheyer, co-founder of Siri; Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble and former partner at Y Combinator; Plug & Play Ventures; among others.\n\nAn open approach\n\nMonocle\u2019s open-source community has already gained a dedicated following. In March, it went viral thanks to a group of Stanford students who transformed the eyepiece into a display for GPT-4. With the ability to listen to a user\u2019s conversation through their phone\u2019s microphone in real time, Monocle can generate personalized support, such as offering suggestions for what to say on a date.\n\nThe computing process happens on OpenAI\u2019s server. The responses are then transmitted through Bluetooth from the user\u2019s phone to Monocle and projected to the lens in front of the user\u2019s eye.\n\nsay goodbye to awkward dates and job interviews \u2639\ufe0f we made rizzGPT \u2014 real-time Charisma as a Service (CaaS) Techcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The arGPT solution, as it\u2019s called, is able to receive sound natively through Monocle\u2019s mic and other sensors, enabling low-latency dialogue with GPT-4.\n\nSo far, Monocle has mostly attracted developers, hackers, hobbyists and researchers experimenting with the little palm-sized device, an approach that the founder believes can unleash the potential of fusing generative AI and AR.\n\n\u201cThere is something important about allowing people to dig into [the AR device\u2019s] heart and understand it and play with it and share that with others, not just passively receive something that\u2019s the closed box that a few people far away have designed for the rest of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s something really philosophically important there.\u201d\n\nThe challenge, of course, is how it branches out of the initial geeky customer base and comes up with a product that appeals to the broader consumer market.\n\nA lightweight strategy\n\nMonocle comes with five different processors, including a hackable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator chip that handles the data coming in from the device\u2019s camera, microphone and capacitive touch sensor. The use of low-power electronics and miniaturized electronic parts, according to the founder, allows the lens to be compact and weigh only 15 grams.\n\n\u201cEvery other device company was doing bulky, expensive headsets. They weren\u2019t making money out of them,\u201d said Tavangar. \u201cThis age of AI is upon us, and from day one \u2014 even before GPT \u2014 we saw a market opportunity with computer vision.\u201d\n\nAt this stage, a smartphone is needed to act as a point of relay between Monocle and cloud-based AI apps. In the long term, however, the goal is to create a direct connection between the hardware and the cloud, doing away with the need for a phone host.\n\nEventually, the company\u2019s vision is to run deep learning models directly on its tiny AR devices, which means even lower latency and functionality even if an internet connection is lost.\n\nBrilliant Labs\u2019 emphasis on a lightweight design extends to its management style. Despite being established in 2019, the startup is still run solely by its three co-founders, which makes one wonder why other mixed reality device makers need hundreds if not thousands of staff. There are signs of overhiring. In February 2021, as many as 200 people were affected during a layoff at Pico, a VR company acquired by ByteDance.\n\nTavangar attributes his management style to his time at Apple, where he worked as a program lead. He believes that focus is key, and that success comes from choosing one idea to pursue out of hundreds of potential options.\n\n\u201cHow do you do really lightweight, affordable, focused hardware to deliver that AI-powered experience? [We are not chasing] the graphical intensity or big field of view [but rather] the singular AI in front of the eye experience,\u201d the founder suggested.\n\n\u201cThat means you don\u2019t need an army of people who are battling with Qualcomm and all of these various different vendors and engaging in really risky, low-yield R&D and production, and still selling your end device at a loss. It means that we work with technology that has high yield and factory-floor partners that are eager to work with us, in some cases, have invested in us, like our key optics manufacturer and contract manufacturer.\u201d\n\nPath to profitability\n\nWhile Tavangar declined to disclose Monocle\u2019s sales figures, he said Brilliant Labs makes \u201ca fair bit of money per unit\u201d and \u201cthe margins are really good.\u201d The company does \u201cquite well\u201d just from hardware sales without any marketing efforts, he added.\n\n\u201cThis is again something I learned from Apple. If you can get the unit economics right and if your yields are 80, 90% and above at low volume, then you\u2019ve got the operational discipline, the good foundation, and are able to start scaling and be a profitable company,\u201d the founder said.\n\nCase in point, the startup is currently seeing \u201calmost 3x in terms of what we\u2019re able to sell it for versus what it costs us to make it.\u201d In comparison, many other mixed reality companies are selling at zero or negative margins, Tavangar said.\n\nAside from selling hardware, Brilliant Labs plans to layer on more services powered by large language models, which presents an opportunity to charge for the services. Brilliant Labs integrated with GPT first because it has a \u201cwell-documented API.\u201d But the large language model is compute-intensive and the team is constantly on the look for more compressed LLMs.\n\n\u201cI think over time we will see how compressed the models can become even as efficiency increases. As an undercurrent to that, the hardware we make will be more powerful even as the hardware stays low power,\u201d the founder said.\n\nThe company is on track to \u201cfar exceed\u201d its sales target this year. It has close to 2,000 developers in its Discord community to date.\n\nWhen questioned about Brilliant Labs\u2019 competitive edge, Tavangar reckoned that the startup\u2019s tightly integrated software and hardware ecosystem is hard to copy, not least because it has a fledgling open-source community.\n\nThe company also enjoys a data advantage, he said, as the user information collected by the sensors continues to inform the AI services running on the platform, which in turn improves user personalization. Brilliant Labs does not store any customer data on its devices or server as it\u2019s \u201cnot interested in selling data to advertisers,\u201d the founder noted."}
