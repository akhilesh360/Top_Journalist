These new ad breaks will display a countdown timer that stops users from being able to browse through more content on the app until they view the ad, according to informational text displayed in the Instagram app.\n\nThe change would see the social network becoming more like the free version of YouTube, which requires users to view ads before and in the middle of watching videos. It makes sense that Instagram would consider going this route, too, given that it has also shifted over the years to become more of a video-sharing network, thanks to features like Stories and Reels, rather than a place to only share still photos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always testing formats that can drive value for advertisers,\u201d a Meta company spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cAs we test and learn, we will provide updates should this test result in any formal product changes,\u201d they noted.\n\nThe new \u201cad break\u201d feature was spotted initially by Instagram app user Dan Levy, who posted a screenshot of the test to his account on X. The app stopped Levy from scrolling past the ad when it appeared, he said \u2014 something he thought was a \u201cbonkers move.\u201d\n\nHoly moly! Meta seemingly is now forcing us to watch ads in our feeds on Instagram!\n\n\n\nThe app legit stopped me from scrolling past this ad which is just a bonkers move to me. pic.twitter.com/740EXjGyl2 \u2014 Dan Levy \u2721 \u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05dc\u05d5\u05d9 (@TheDanLevy) June 1, 2024\n\nA follow-up post on Reddit clarified that if you click the info icon next to the ad break to learn more, you\u2019ll see a message that reads: \u201cYou\u2019re seeing an ad break. Ad breaks are a new way of seeing ads on Instagram. Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you keep browsing.\u201d\n\nOther commenters confirmed that they had also seen the feature at times. As you might imagine, the majority of the reactions were negative. Some people threatened to close Instagram if they came across \u201cad breaks\u201d like this, while others said they would stop using the app entirely. In addition, commenters questioned whether this decision was driven by a need to increase engagement on ads, at the expense of the consumer experience.\n\nLevy\u2019s post has since been recirculated by other accounts on X, like @howfxr and @Dexerto.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The screenshots, however, show the ad breaks appearing in the app\u2019s Feed while watching video posts. It\u2019s not clear at this time if Instagram creators will have any control over these ads\u2019 appearance.\n\nFor now, the feature is just a test, but it demonstrates to what extent Meta is willing to experiment with the app\u2019s core user experience in favor of increased ad revenues."}
