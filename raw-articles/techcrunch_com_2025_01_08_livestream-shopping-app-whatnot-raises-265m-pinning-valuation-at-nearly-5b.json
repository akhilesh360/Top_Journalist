This round puts Whatnot\u2019s valuation at $4.97 billion.\n\nThe investment marks an important milestone for Whatnot and highlights the potential for livestream shopping to grow in the U.S. The considerable amount raised reflects investors\u2019 belief that Whatnot can innovate further in the space, particularly in collectibles and niche items, which is Whatnot\u2019s focus area.\n\nThe new capital will be allocated to expanding into more categories, including art, golf, and vinyl. Whatnot is also working on new seller tools designed to assist sellers in growing their businesses. One of these tools aims to simplify the management of inventory and orders for sellers.\n\nWhatnot also plans to launch in Australia next month as well as other markets in Europe later this year. It\u2019s currently available in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, and Belgium.\n\nFounded by Grant LaFontaine and Logan Head in 2019, Whatnot\u2019s platform is today designed for collectors, differentiating itself from competitors focused on fashion and beauty products. Initially centered on sports trading cards, action figures, comic books, and memorabilia, it has expanded over time to include accessories, clothing, electronics, live plants, and more.\n\nA key feature of the platform is its \u201csudden death\u201d auctions, where the last bidder wins the item. Recently, Whatnot introduced a new selling method called flash sales, which allows sellers to offer customizable, time-sensitive discounts on products. During livestreams, a countdown clock creates a sense of urgency among buyers. Last year, the platform launched a new rewards tool that allows buyers to redeem rewards from sellers after completing certain achievements and leveling up.\n\nAlongside the funding announcement, Whatnot said it plans to launch its first-ever tender offer to buy back up to $72 million worth of shares. The company told us that this move reflects its commitment to investing in its 600 full-time employees. Share buybacks often suggest that a company is performing well and can afford to invest in its workforce, whether through salaries, benefits, or other investments.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

To date, Whatnot has raised approximately $746 million.\n\nWhatnot also revealed that its annual gross merchandise value (GMV) for livestream sales surpassed $3 billion after recently reporting an annual GMV of over $2 billion."}
