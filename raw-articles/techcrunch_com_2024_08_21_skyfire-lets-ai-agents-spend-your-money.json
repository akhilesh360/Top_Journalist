Today, an AI agent might be able to plan a vacation for you independently, but a human has to step in when it\u2019s time to input your credit card information. Skyfire Systems wants to change that.\n\nSkyfire created a payment network specifically for AI agents to make autonomous transactions. Now, obviously, AI agents are hard to control today, so the idea of one tied to your bank account is terrifying. However, Skyfire uses a number of safeguards to prevent AI agents from overspending, making the whole thing a little less scary.\n\nSkyfire assigns each AI agent a digital wallet with a unique identifier, where businesses can deposit a set amount of funds they want the agent to spend, so they don\u2019t get unlimited access to a bank account. Skyfire also allows customers to set limits on how much an AI agent can spend in one transaction and over time. If an AI agent tries to overspend, it will ping a human to review it. Skyfire also offers a dashboard to view exactly how much, and where, their agent is spending.\n\nSkyfire\u2019s dashboard to track AI agent spending.

Now he\u2019s trying to develop an open protocol to power payments in the AI era.\n\n\u201cAI agents can\u2019t do anything if they can\u2019t make payments; it\u2019s just a glorified search,\u201d said Skyfire co-founder and chief product officer Craig DeWitt in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cEither we figure out a way where agents are actually able to do things, or they don\u2019t do anything, and therefore, they\u2019re not agents.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Skyfire officially launched its payment network and announced $8.5 million in seed funding raised from Neuberger Berman, Inception Capital, Arrington Capital, and other investors. (Arrington Capital is led by Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch, who left the publication in 2011.)\n\nPayments for agents\n\nNotably, Skyfire doesn\u2019t build the AI agents, but plenty of companies already are: They\u2019re all trying to make sure agents don\u2019t go rogue and send 4,000 printers to the office when the old one runs out of ink (ideally, just one). Even though Skyfire has added safeguards, the founders say that aligning AI agents to act responsibly is ultimately up to the companies behind them.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The founders were early executives at the cryptocurrency startup Ripple, helping to build a cross-border payments network that processed more than $50 billion during their time there.\n\nBusinesses can deposit and withdraw U.S. dollars from Skyfire, but under the hood, the platform is converting those dollars into a digital stablecoin. Skyfire uses USDC, a digital stablecoin pegged to the American dollar\u2019s value, and holds it in a wallet tied to that agent.\n\nSkyfire collects 2% to 3% of every transaction to generate revenue but says verification services could be another source of revenue moving forward. As AI companies struggle to generate returns on expensive models, it\u2019s possible more will turn to payments as a means to break even.\n\nAI agents on a shopping spree\n\nIn a beta test over the last two months, some AI agents have already been spending their companies\u2019 dollars with Skyfire, the founders tell TechCrunch.\n\nDenso, a global auto parts manufacturer, created AI agents to source materials without the help of humans. These systems could find the materials Denso wanted to buy but required humans to step in at the end of the month and conduct a wire payment. Now Skyfire enables Denso\u2019s AI agents to work truly autonomously.\n\nAnother company already using Skyfire is Payman, which allows AI to pay humans for various tasks, kind of like Fiverr. With Skyfire\u2019s platform, Payman\u2019s AI agents can now hire and fulfill payments to contract workers completely autonomously, at least in theory.\n\nFor now, Skyfire is focused on B2B use cases for its payments network. But Skyfire\u2019s CEO says that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\n\u201cThe protocol we built will be an open protocol that any company, even a competitor, can use,\u201d said Sarhangi in an interview. \u201cWe want this to be the thing everybody uses when it comes to payments in the AI world.\u201d\n\nSkyfire\u2019s founders believe AI agents will fundamentally shift the way things are purchased on the internet. To buy something online today, humans fill out lots of personal information and select images of traffic cones to verify your identity. Skyfire hopes its payments network makes the interface obsolete, and your AI agent can one day just act as a secure intermediary between vendors and your bank account."}
