These companies are looking to fill the massive gap left by the retirement of the Ariane 5 and major delays to the Ariane 6 and Vega C rockets; the absence of these vehicles means there is essentially zero native launch capacity coming out of Europe.\n\nBut the absence also means opportunity for Orbex. The company is developing a \u201cmicrolauncher\u201d: a two-stage vehicle called Prime that stands just 19 meters tall, designed to carry payloads up to 180 kilograms. The closest comparison is Rocket Lab\u2019s Electron, which is a meter shorter but can carry up to 300 kilograms.\n\nTo Orbex, this small stature is a benefit, not a drawback, and Orbex CEO Phillip Chambers told TechCrunch via email that the company is seeing \u201cpositive market conditions\u201d for its product.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an exponential growth of satellites being launched into LEO and demand for launch is far exceeding supply \u2014 at the present time it\u2019s not possible to launch a single kilogram from Europe and there is pent-up demand for sovereign launch capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will offer freedom of action to European customers to be in control of their own launches and launch European Payloads from European soil.\u201d\n\nPrime will be launched from a new spaceport in Sutherland, in northern Scotland, which is being constructed with the help of funding from the U.K.\u2019s national space agency. The aim is eventually to incorporate a patented recovery technology the company calls Reflight. This is an interstage structure that sits between the rocket stages; after the booster detaches, four \u201cpetals\u201d will fold out and, along with a parachute, will create enough drag to enable a soft ocean splashdown.\n\nA larger vehicle could eventually be in the plans as well, though Chambers was clear that Prime was the company\u2019s first priority. However, he said that many of that rocket\u2019s core technologies could scale to support larger payloads.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The new capital comes after Orbex closed a \u00a340.4 million ($50 million) Series C in October 2022. While a spokesperson confirmed the new funding will \u201chelp Orbex ramp up the development of Prime \u2026 to ensure full readiness and scalability for its launch period,\u201d a firm launch window has yet to be announced."}
