Sure!\n\nEveryone knows that when you think about X, you immediately think of closing a tab the twenty fourth letter of the alphabet porn Ed Sheeran\u2019s second studio album, X, which peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 brand safety. So, under advertising veteran and new Twitter X CEO Linda Yaccarino, the social platform is throwing a Hail Mary to appeal to advertisers, who have largely fled X since it was sold to Elon Musk.\n\nX is expanding its partnership with Integral Ad Science (IAS), which it began working with in January to tell advertisers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. Now, X is testing sensitivity settings, powered by machine learning, that let advertisers choose their thresholds for the kinds of content they want their ads to appear around \u2014 and according to a tweet from X owner Elon Musk, advertisers can buy these less desirable, \u201crelaxed\u201d sensitivity ad slots for less.\n\n\u201cI would recommend advertisers not be super concerned about content adjacency,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cTesla and SpaceX are not and the \u2018less desirable\u2019 ad inventory is much cheaper!\u201d\n\nIn the most conservative setting, brands can reduce adjacency to gore, excessive profanity and obscenity, targeted hate speech, sexual content, drugs and spam. However, X\u2019s AI moderation tools have proven deeply unskillful at detecting spam, so it\u2019s a good thing that X is claiming to \u201creduce,\u201d rather than \u201celiminate\u201d adjacency to such content. Soon, X will add its \u201crelaxed\u201d setting, which offers cheaper advertising opportunities while only filtering for targeted hate speech and explicit sexual content.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s basic economics. If you have more supply than demand, lower your prices\u2026 and also lower the quality of your product, I guess."}
