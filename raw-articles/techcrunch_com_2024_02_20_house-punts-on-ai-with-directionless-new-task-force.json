But the announcement feels more like a punt after years of indecision that show no sign of ending.\n\nIn a way this task force \u2014 chaired by California Reps Ted Lieu and Jay Obernolte \u2014 is a welcome sign of Congress doing something, anything, on an important topic that has become the darling of tech investment. But in another, more important way, it comes off as lip service at a time many feel AI and tech are running circles around regulators and lawmakers.\n\nFurthermore, the dispiriting partisanship and obstruction on display every day in Congress renders quaint any notion that this task force would produce anything of value at any time, let alone during a historically divisive election year.\n\n\u201cAs new innovations in AI continue to emerge, Congress and our partners in federal government must keep up. House Republicans and Democrats will work together to create a comprehensive report detailing the regulatory standards and congressional actions needed to both protect consumers and foster continued investment and innovation in AI,\u201d said Rep. Obernolte in the announcement.\n\nAnd Rep. Lieu: \u201cAI has the capability of changing our lives as we know it. The question is how to ensure AI benefits society instead of harming us. As a recovering Computer Science major, I know this will not be an easy or quick or one-time task, but I believe Congress has an essential role to play in the future of AI. I have been heartened to see so many Members of Congress of all political persuasions agree.\u201d\n\nOf course, the White House, numerous agencies, the EU and countless other authorities and organizations are already issuing \u201ccomprehensive reports\u201d and recommending legislative actions, but what\u2019s one more?\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This task force is long overdue, and as such we may welcome it but also treat it with the same skepticism that lawmaker pandering deserves.\n\nEveryone involved with this will point to it when asked why they haven\u2019t acted on AI, which many voters fear is coming for their jobs or automating processes that once had a purposeful human touch. \u201cBut we started this task force!\u201d Yes, and the EU has had their task force working on this subject since the pandemic days.\n\nThe announcement of the task force kept expectations low, with no timeline or deliverables that voters or watchdogs can hold them to. Even the report is something they will only \u201cseek\u201d to produce!\n\nFurthermore, considering the expert agencies are at risk of declawing via Supreme Court decision, it is hard to even imagine what a regulatory structure would look like a year from now. Want the FTC, FCC, SEC, EPA or anyone else to help out? They may be judicially restrained from doing so come 2025.\n\nPerhaps this task force is Congress\u2019s admission that during such tumultuous times, and lacking any real insight into an issue, all they can do is say \u201cwe\u2019ll look into it.\u201d"}
