BUZZ vehicles \u2014 in multiple U.S. cities over the next decade.\n\nThe companies expect to launch a commercial service in Los Angeles, the first city on the list, by late 2026. VW and Uber didn\u2019t provide details on potential future markets.\n\nInitially, the service won\u2019t be driverless. The fleet of autonomous vehicles will have human safety operators behind the wheel before they go driverless in 2027, a VW spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nThat gives Volkswagen ADMT, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Volkswagen of America, up to two years to navigate the regulatory landscape in California and gain the permits required to test its autonomous vehicles and eventually operate a commercial service.\n\nVolkswagen ADMT will begin testing in Los Angeles later this year once it receives its initial testing permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The agency regulates autonomous vehicle testing and deployment in the state, and the California Public Utilities Commission handles permitting for the commercial ride-hailing component of robotaxi services.\n\nDespite the considerable hurdles ahead, the partnership is a notable step for Volkswagen ADMT. The subsidiary publicly launched in July 2023 with an autonomous vehicle test program in Austin and a fleet of 10 all-electric ID. Buzz vehicles equipped with partner Mobileye\u2019s technology.\n\nIts parent Volkswagen Group, along with Ford, had hitched their autonomous vehicles ambitions to startup Argo, until the two automakers pulled financial support and gobbled up its remains. Volkswagen then turned to Mobileye to source autonomous vehicle technology, and that relationship has deepened recently. ADMT, Volkswagen\u2019s U.S.-based effort, launched about nine months after Argo shut down.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Still, it did appear to see a business in selling its self-driving ID. Buzz vans and fleet management software to other companies.\n\nDetails of its partnership with Uber suggest that plan is intact.\n\n\u201cVolkswagen is not just a car manufacturer \u2014 we are shaping the future of mobility, and our collaboration with Uber accelerates that vision,\u201d Christian Senger, CEO of Volkswagen Autonomous Mobility, said in a statement. \u201cWhat really sets us apart is our ability to combine the best of both worlds\u2013high-volume manufacturing expertise with cutting-edge technology and a deep understanding of urban mobility needs.\u201d\n\nThis is also Uber\u2019s latest AV partnership. The ride-hailing giant has spent the past several years locking up deals with more than 14 autonomous vehicle firms across ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking. Uber recently launched a robotaxi service with Waymo in Austin, and is about to do the same in Atlanta."}
