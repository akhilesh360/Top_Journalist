Brands reach out with promotions and discounts. But the engagement and read rates tend to be low; according to Gartner, brands risk losing 38% of customers due to poor marketing personalization efforts.\n\nStefanos Loukakos, the former head of Meta\u2019s business-focused Messenger division, thought the solution might lie in algorithms to drive marketing at the right time \u2014 and to the right person.\n\nTo test this theory, Loukakos founded Connectly, which hosts a platform for businesses to create messaging campaigns and automate conversations with customers across messaging apps. Connectly today announced that it raised $7.85 million in a Series A round led by Volpe Capital with participation from RX Ventures and DST Global managing partner Saurabh Gupta, bringing the startup\u2019s total raised to $17.25 million.\n\nLoukakos launched Connectly in 2020 alongside Yandong Liu, previously a lead engineer on Uber\u2019s machine learning team, whom he met through a mutual friend in the founder community.\n\nUsing Connectly, brands can create campaigns and chatbots to automate text message conversations with customers. Loukakos pitches it as a way for brands to capture customers that\u2019d otherwise potentially fall through the cracks.\n\n\u201cConnectly can tailor suggestions to ensure customers discover products they\u2019ll love, as well as help companies gain a deeper understanding of their customers,\u201d Loukakos said. \u201cWhile traditional automation players focus on one-way messages, Connectly specializes in conversations with current and potential buyers \u2014 enabling outbound and inbound solutions.\u201d\n\nFor example, if a customer abandons a cart on a brand\u2019s website, Connectly can detect this and then send them a message asking why they didn\u2019t make a purchase, Loukakos says. If the customer is \u201chigh value,\u201d Connectly can offer to extend them a discount or lower-cost shipping.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

According to one recent survey of around 1,200 SMS users, nearly half reported being \u201cannoyed\u201d by text message marketing, with 28% saying that they\u2019d abandoned at least one brand out of irritation.\n\nConnectly appears to have had some success, though, with a customer base hovering around 200 brands and annual recurring revenue just eclipsing $3.5 million.\n\nDespite competition from incumbents like Twilio and startups such as MessageBird and Attentive, the company is well-positioned for growth, Loukakos asserts, with plans to grow headcount from 35 employees to close to 40 by year-end 2023.\n\nUpdated on 3/7 at 5:42 p.m. Eastern: DST Global didn\u2019t invest in Connectly as originally written \u2014 only DST Global managing partner Saurabh Gupta. We\u2019ve made the correction and regret the error."}
