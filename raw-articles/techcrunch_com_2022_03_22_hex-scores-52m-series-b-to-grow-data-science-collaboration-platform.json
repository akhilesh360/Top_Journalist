All of these people can come into Hex. They can collaborate, they can analyze data, and they can share it.\u201d\n\nHe sees Hex as the interface for the modern stack, which could include lots of tools, notably including investors Snowflake and Databricks. \u201cWe want that data to be useful. And we want people to be able to access and analyze it. Hex is an unlock for that,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Wang, general partner at a16z, who will be joining the Hex board as part of the funding deal, sees the startup as reimagining data collaboration. \u201cHex is transforming the data space by enabling data scientists to connect their data, analyze it, and then share it through interactive and collaborative apps that get both technical and non-technical teams to the right decisions faster,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nWhen we last spoke to Hex in October around its $16 million Series A, the company was talking in terms of dozens of customers. McCardel said that since that time, the number of customers and revenue has grown 4x, and that\u2019s just in five months.\n\nThe company has also almost doubled the number of employees since October, growing from 18 to 35, with plans to roughly double again in the next year. At the time of its Series A, McCardel said his company was putting a lot of focus and intentionality on building a diverse team, and as it grows, that continues to be the focus.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And I think if you look at the results we\u2019ve been able to drive, it\u2019s really a reflection of that incredible group of people we\u2019ve brought together,\u201d McCardel said.\n\nThe company announced the $52 million Series B today. In addition to a16z and the two strategics, existing investors Redpoint and Amplify Partners also participated in the round. The investment builds on the $5.5 million seed in 2020 and the $16 million Series A in 2020 for a total of over $73 million raised."}
