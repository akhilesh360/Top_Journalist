Lockheed, which holds a 28.3% stake in Terran Orbital, strategically invested in Terran Orbital through its Lockheed Martin Ventures investing arm in 2017, 2020 and 2022. This will be the first LMV portfolio company that Lockheed Martin will acquire since the fund was founded in 2007. Satellite bus contracts for Lockheed represent around 70% of the company\u2019s revenue and 91% of the company\u2019s backlog.\n\nTerran Orbital got a major boost at the beginning of 2023, when it announced a $2.4 billion, 300-satellite deal for Rivada Space Networks, a company that wants to build a satellite communications constellation. However, Rivada delayed its incremental payments toward the order, and in its recent earnings report Terran Orbital said it was removing the Rivada deal from its backlog.\n\nLockheed first proposed acquiring the company for more than $500 million in March. Terran Orbital responded by introducing a limited-duration stockholder rights plan, or a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d to prevent the buy-out. Lockheed dropped its bid in May.\n\nTerran Orbital reported cash reserves of $14.6 million as of July 31, down from $30.6 million as of the end of June. It told regulators on August 12 that it was pursuing \u201ca range of strategic options\u201d to address its need for cash. As of market close on Wednesday, Terran Orbital stock was trading at $0.40 per share.\n\nTerran Orbital is now the second space company to leave the public markets after entering them at billion-dollar-plus valuations. Terran Orbital made its public debut at a $1.8 billion valuation; Astra Space, the other space company that finalized its take-private deal over the summer, went public at a valuation of $2.1 billion. At the time of their private deals, both companies were worth just a fraction of those amounts."}
