AI automation can help, but it takes more tailoring than for other insurance types.\n\nAutomating property and casualty insurance, for instance, gave rise to public company Guidewire decades ago, but health insurance is a tougher vertical. \u201cYou can\u2019t automate in a simplistic way, like you could for a broken car windshield,\u201d Paris-based entrepreneur Tarik Dadi told TechCrunch.\n\nHis startup, Qantev, is hoping to solve this. It provides clients like AXA and Generali with software that helps them manage claims via AI models that go through the same checks as in-house medical staff currently do: \u201cIs the care medically necessary? Is the price right? Is the bill fraudulent?\u201d But it does it much faster, which helps reduce costs and customer churn.\n\nDadi saw that need while working as a senior data scientist at AXA, while now-CTO Hadrien de March, a doctorate and former quant, had the math chops to address it. The two of them joined forces at Entrepreneur First in late 2018. \u201cEF\u2019s concept is \u2018pre-idea, pre-team,\u2019 but I cheated and brought the idea,\u201d Dadi said.\n\nArmed with an idea and a small team, Qantev went on to raise a \u20ac1.7 million seed round led by Elaia in 2020, followed by a \u20ac10 million Series A round led by Omnes and Raise Ventures in 2022. These three VC firms are now participating in Qantev\u2019s \u20ac30 million Series B round, which happened sooner than planned, Dadi said.\n\n\u201cOur topics are quite hot at the moment, and we saw that YC, at the beginning of the year, included at least three of our topics in their wishlist,\u201d he said, referring to Y Combinator\u2019s Request for Startups and to what he calls the \u201cLLM craze.\u201d \u201cWe started to see lots of small startups popping up in the U.S. and just throwing an LLM at the problem. [\u2026] We know that it\u2019s a hard problem and that we have an asset.\u201d\n\nOne conviction Qantev developed over the last five years is that one large model is not enough; its software relies on a collection of AI models trained on historical data from its clients and aiming for accuracy. \u201cYou can\u2019t have hallucinations or anything like that. It\u2019s human health; you can\u2019t refuse care for someone\u2019s cancer. That\u2019s why we are still a big AI shop. We have many PhD and ML experts in our team because we have to create small AI models that are highly specialized in our topics,\u201d Dadi said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Its goal is to double its headcount by the end of the year.\n\nLed by Blossom Capital, the Series B round will also support Qantev\u2019s international expansion; it plans to grow its Asia-focused Hong Kong office and make a strong push in North America.\n\nWhile it has competitors there, such as Alaffia Health and Anomaly, other Blossom portfolio companies have made strong headways in the U.S. in recent years, and Qantev has an advantage of its own: Its customers are large and global, generating organic expansion when a new subsidiary adopts its software.\n\nThe downside of targeting such large clients is that sales cycles are long and complicated. \u201cBut the upside is that they\u2019re big-ticket items,\u201d Dadi said. He liked Blossom\u2019s understanding of enterprise software as a category, and of Qantev\u2019s ambition to become an operating system for health insurance. \u201cWe like saying it is a platform, because it\u2019s going to be multiple products.\u201d\n\nWhat these products might be remains to be confirmed, although underwriting seems to be a strong candidate. For now, Qantev prioritizes claims management, but it is easy to see how it could leverage the legitimacy and data access it is gaining from its early customers to help them streamline other operations, as it is already doing with fraud detection. Looking at the big picture, this would tie back to the trend of AI as a way to fight rising healthcare costs."}
