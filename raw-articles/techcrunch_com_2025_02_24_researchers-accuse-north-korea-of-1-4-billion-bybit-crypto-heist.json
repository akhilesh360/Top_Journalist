The researcher said he was able to track the stolen cryptocurrency from Bybit to wallets used in previous hacks against Phemex, BingX, and Poloniex, which have all been linked to North Korea.\n\nWhen TechCrunch asked how confident he was of North Korea being behind the Bybit hack ZachXBT said: \u201c100%,\u201d and pointed to those previous hacks. \u201cLaw enforcement is also treating it that way,\u201d said ZachXBT.\n\nBlockchain monitoring firm Elliptic also reached the same conclusion. \u201cBeginning minutes after the theft from Bybit, the Elliptic team have been working around the clock with Bybit, our customers and fellow investigators, to trace these funds and prevent the North Korean regime from benefitting from them,\u201d Elliptic wrote in a blog post.\n\nElliptic said it believes North Korean hackers were responsible, \u201cbased on various factors, including our analysis of the laundering of the stolen cryptoassets.\u201d The company added that Lazarus Group follows a \u201ccharacteristic pattern\u201d to launder the crypto it steals.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about the Bybit hack, or other crypto heists?
