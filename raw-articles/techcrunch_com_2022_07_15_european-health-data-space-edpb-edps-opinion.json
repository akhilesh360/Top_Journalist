Simplifying the process of sharing this sensitive, \u2018special category\u2019 data is thus a key driver for the EHDS \u2014 with lawmakers talking up the potential for the continent if fragmentation can be banished and citizens\u2019 health data more easily pooled, processed and reused for purposes such as research into diseases and drug discovery, or for innovative health tech (like AI diagnosis).\n\nHomegrown European health tech startups, like telehealth platform Kry, have also weighed in with some supportive words for the EU\u2019s plan.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

By restricting the right to information under the GDPR, the EDPB and the EDPS are of the view that the Proposal may not achieve the objectives laid down in Article 1(2)(a) of the Proposal. In fact, the envisaged approach appears to undermine the rights of natural persons to privacy and to the protection of personal data, especially taking into account the very broad definition of secondary use and the minimum categories of electronic data for secondary use introduced by the Proposal, which is not only limited to scientific research but also includes other purposes, such as innovation,\u201d they warn in the opinion.\n\n\u201cGiven the wide scope of the rights and obligations set out in the Proposal with regard to the access, use and sharing of special categories of personal data as is the case for health data, general references to the GDPR and the EUDPR [data protection regulation] may not suffice. In this regard, the EDPB and the EDPS consider that there may be a risk of misinterpreting key provisions related to data protection which, in turn, may lead to a lowering of the level of protection currently granted to data subjects under the existing EU data protection legal framework (GDPR, EUDPR and ePrivacy Directive). Therefore, the EDPB and the EDPS consider further specifications necessary,\u201d they add.\n\nIn an accompanying statement, EDPB chair, Andrea Jelinek, also warns: \u201cThe EU Health Data Space will involve the processing of large quantities of data which are of a highly sensitive nature. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the rights of the EEA\u2019s individuals are by no means undermined by this Proposal. The description of the rights in the Proposal is not consistent with the GDPR and there is a substantial risk of legal uncertainty for individuals who may not be able to distinguish between the two types of rights. We strongly urge the Commission to clarify the interplay of the different rights between the Proposal and the GDPR.\u201d\n\nRisks of \u2018Quantified self\u2019 data\n\nThe two data supervisors are also recommending that the proposed for a European Heath Data Space is revised to shrink the types of information in scope \u2014 to only include bona fide health data \u2014 advocating for the removal of a reference that would also draw in data from wellness and other consumer health/fitness apps (such as behavioral/lifestyle data) too, where it has been uploaded to a person\u2019s electronic health record (EHR).\n\nThe pair argue that including such data would pose a major privacy risk for individuals, since such high dimension lifestyle/behavioral data could be used to make sensitive inferences about the data subjects linked to their health.\n\nThey also raise a further concern \u2014 warning that consumer-grade tech does not generate the same quality of data as professional health services and medical devices. Ergo, bundling it with robust health data could lead to other problematic and potentially discriminatory linkages being made.\n\n\u201cThe EDPB and the EDPS are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated the use of medical devices, wellness applications or wearables amongst the general population. However, this kind of technology generates an enormous amount of data, often special categories of personal data, and can be highly invasive. More than tracking humans\u2019 actions and decisions, it is now possible to track humans\u2019 bodies, minds and emotions at a level that even humans themselves might not be able to do. These data can then be used to predict people\u2019s actions and manipulate their behaviour, even at a group level,\u201d they write in the opinion.\n\n\u201cMandatory availability of electronic heath data generated by medical devices, wellness applications or other digital health applications for secondary use must be assessed against the rapid technological developments in mobile and wearable technology and the increasing popularity of \u2018quantified self\u2019 apps and devices, that allow people to register all kinds of aspects about their personality, mind, body, behavioural patterns and whereabouts,\u201d they also recommend. \u201cClearly these types of data processing deserve significant attention, since it is not easy to recognize as the processing of health data by the concerned data subjects. However, at the same time this brings real privacy risks, especially in the case where such data are processed for additional purposes and/or combined with other data or transferred to third parties.\n\n\u201cThese types of data processing may create specific risks, including the risk of unequal or unfair treatment based on data about a person\u2019s assumed or actual health status derived, for example through profiling, of very intimate details concerning his/her private life, irrespective of whether these conclusions concerning his/her health status are accurate or not. In fact, those risks may also be linked to the reliability and accuracy of data generated by medical devices, wellness applications or other digital health applications. Against this background, the EDPB and the EDPS acknowledge that Article 33(3) attempts at delimiting which data generated by medical devices, wellness applications or other digital health applications shall be made available for secondary uses. However, the EDPB and the EDPS underline that it is still unclear either what kind of data fall under this category or who would assess its validity and quality once inserted by individuals in their own EHR pursuant to Articles 3(6).\u201d\n\nIf EU lawmakers are set on maintaining such data in scope of the sharing framework, the pair recommend the proposal is amended to ensure individuals remain free to decide \u201cif and which of their personal data generated by wellness application and other digital applications\u2026 shall be shared with other recipients and further processed for secondary uses\u201d.\n\nAny further processing must also clearly comply with data protection legislation, they stress, and there must also be \u201csuitable mechanisms\u201d put in place to ensure that data subjects\u2019 choices are respected. (Which could be a warning against any moves to replicate adtech style \u2018consent\u2019 systems, which certainly get people\u2019s data moving but have been found to breach the GDPR\u2026 )\n\n\u201cHealth data generated by wellness applications and other digital health applications are not of the same quality as those generated by medical devices. Moreover, these applications generate an enormous amount of data, can be highly invasive and may reveal particularly sensitive information, such as religious orientation. Wellness applications and other digital health applications should therefore be excluded from being made available for secondary use,\u201d said EDPS supervisor Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski in another supporting statement.\n\nThe two data supervisors go on to warn that the \u201csuccess\u201d of the EHDS will depend on what they summarize as \u201ca robust legal basis for processing in line with EU data protection law, the establishment of a strong data governance mechanism and effective safeguards for the rights and interests of natural persons that are fully compliant with the GDPR\u201d \u2014 which they emphasize must be accompanied by \u201csufficient assurances of a lawful, responsible, ethical management anchored in EU values, including respect for fundamental rights\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the EDPB and the EDPS consider that the EHDS should serve as an example of transparency, effective accountability and proper balance between the interests of the individual data subjects and the shared interest of society as a whole,\u201d they add.\n\nThe Commission was contacted for a response to the recommendations. At the time of writing it had not sent a reply.\n\nUpdate: Commission officials said it has \u201ctaken note\u201d of the recommendations and is \u201ccarefully scrutinizing\u201d the proposals of EDPB and EDPS.\n\n\u201cThe EDPB and the EDPS welcomed the idea of strengthening the control of individuals over their personal health data and facilitating both the primary and secondary use of electronic health data, meanwhile the EDPB and EDPS in their opinion made recommendations for co-legislators concerning some data protection aspects,\u201d the Commission source added.\n\nData strategy\n\nThe process of EU lawmaking typically loops in the European Parliament and Council, as co-legislators, who vote on and can amend Commission proposals \u2014 so there is an established path for addressing the two data supervisors\u2019 concerns if there is consensus that the framework needs to be bolstered to protect fundamental rights.\n\nThe EHDS fits into an overarching strategy by the bloc\u2019s lawmakers, set out by the Commission back in 2020, to boost data reuse for economic and societal gain.\n\nSince then, the EU\u2019s executive has been busy slotting in key regulatory planks, such as the Data Governance Act (introduced at the end of 2021, it was adopted by the co-legislators this year and entered into force on June 23); and the Data Act (proposed February 2022).\n\nInternal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, has suggested the data strategy will help Europe tip the scales away from US-dominated Big Tech \u2014 by putting enabling rules and infrastructure in place that will make the region \u201cthe most data-empowered continent in the world\u201d, as he has put it.\n\nHowever critics who blame the EU\u2019s relative lack of homegrown tech giants on its penchant for high dimension regulation are unlikely to be won round to a \u2018medicine\u2019 of (yet) more rules delivering a winning innovation formula.\n\nTime will tell which side is right \u2014 but the Commission is pressing on in the meanwhile.\n\nThe EHDS is the first of what it hopes will be a series of bespoke common \u201cdata spaces\u201d to boost industrial data sharing and reuse and to encourage citizens to donate personal data for \u201caltruistic\u201d causes (like heath research or fighting climate change).\n\nIts plan to spin up these spaces involves coming with dedicated rules and requirements for specific sectoral or topic-based information-sharing hubs \u2014 like the EHDS \u2014 in order to create conditions for \u201csecure and privacy-preserving access and interoperability\u201d via dedicated trusted infrastructure and processes \u2014 and thereby grease the pipes of data sharing for research and innovation.\n\nAnd for economic gain \u2014 with huge store being placed by lawmakers on improving access to data as a strategy to charge up development of Europe\u2019s AI ecosystem.\n\nOther data spaces the Commission has mooted include one for the region\u2019s manufacturing industry; another for mobility; and one for the EU\u2019s green deal, to support the bloc\u2019s decarbonization and emissions reduction goals.\n\nThe rapid adoption of the Data Governance Act suggests there\u2019s broad backing among EU lawmakers for the data reuse strategy. Although certain sectoral/thematic data spaces rules \u2014 such as health \u2014 may generate more debate/dispute as commercial imperatives intersect with individual rights.\n\nHealth is certainly one of the most sensitive areas to encourage data sharing so it may seem an odd choice for the Commission to prioritize for the first common data space. But the COVID-19 pandemic has concentrated lawmakers\u2019 minds on having smoother mechanisms for getting health data moving to be ready for the next emergency.\n\nSince each data space will be accompanied by its own set of bespoke rules the approach will inevitably amp up compliance complexity for those wanting to tap in \u2014 but the idea is the benefits will outweigh the administrative burden.\n\nHowever, as the EDPB and EDPS are warning, the EU increasing the sprawl of digital regulation raises the risk of inconsistencies being introduced into its legal framework which could harm individual rights in areas like data protection as more rules overlap and/or get meshed together.\n\nIt could also create fresh legal uncertainties for business if regulatory requirements fail to line up.\n\nSecurity and privacy researcher, Lukasz Olejnik, who has worked on health tech policy in Europe, agrees this is a growing risk. \u201cIn the previous, and the next five years, policies towards technologies are constantly popping up. Their confluence and fusion may create additional risks: Of compliance, even lesser protections,\u201d he tells TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t deny that digitisation of health data may help lower costs, perhaps even contribute in improving healthcare or even saving lives. But it also carries risks. Of misuse, of leaks, of theft. Such centralised \u2018spaces\u2019 could become a tempting point for cyberattacks,\u201d he also warns."}
