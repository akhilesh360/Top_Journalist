At the same time, Los Angeles-based trans activist Ashlee Marie Preston hosted a rally in solidarity with Netflix workers participating in the walkout. Netflix stars like Jonathan Van Ness of \u201cQueer Eye\u201d and Mason Alexander Park of \u201cCowboy Bebop\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d expressed their solidarity in a video made for the rally, alongside other Hollywood stars and trans advocates like Angelica Ross, Jameela Jamil, Kate Bornstein, Our Lady J, Sara Ramirez, Peppermint and Colton Haynes.\n\n\u201cWe value our trans colleagues and allies, and understand the deep hurt that\u2019s been caused. We respect the decision of any employee who chooses to walk out, and recognize we have much more work to do both within Netflix and in our content,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. The exact turnouts of the employee walkout and solidarity rally are unclear, but there was enough hype around the event that Preston preemptively moved it to a location with more space.\n\nThe employees who participated in the walkout want Netflix to \u201cadopt measures to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,\u201d they wrote in a letter. They want Netflix to address a list of demands in the categories of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction.\n\nWhen it comes to content, the group wants Netflix to increase its funding of trans and non-binary talent, bring employee resource groups into conversations about potentially harmful content, hire more trans and non-binary content executives and revise internal procedures around commissioning and releasing sensitive works. In terms of employee relations and safety, they want Netflix to recruit trans people, especially BIPOC, for leadership roles, allow employees to remove themselves from previous promotional content like allyship and diversity videos, and eliminate references and imagery of transphobic titles and talent in the workplace. For harm reduction, they want Netflix to acknowledge the company\u2019s harm in platforming transphobic content, add a disclaimer before transphobic titles, boost promotion for trans-affirming titles on the platform and suggest trans-affirming content alongside those flagged as anti-trans.\n\nThe demands do not include removing the controversial Dave Chappelle special from Netflix, which sparked backlash from some employees and Netflix subscribers concerned with the company\u2019s platforming of transphobic speech.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

I want to say that we are deeply committed to inclusion on screen and behind the camera and in our workplace,\u201d Sarandos told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nbrb walking out \u2014 Most (@Most) October 20, 2021\n\nHe seemed doubtful that he would meet their demand to add a disclaimer about transphobia before Chapelle\u2019s special.\n\n\u201cThe content is age-restricted already for language, and Dave himself gives a very explicit warning at the beginning of the show, so I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate in this case,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore Netflix released the Chappelle special, employees raised concerns about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show \u2014 Chapelle declared that he\u2019s \u201cTeam TERF,\u201d referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who oppose the movement for transgender rights. But Sarandos doubled down on his defense of the special, writing an internal email that \u201ccontent on screen doesn\u2019t directly translate to real-world harm.\u201d After receiving backlash, he later told The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cI 100% believe that content on screen can have impact in the real world, positive and negative.\u201d\n\nNetflix Senior Software Engineer Terra Field, who is transgender, tweeted a viral thread about the Chappelle special.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t complaining about \u2018being offended,\u2019 and we don\u2019t have \u2018thin skin,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we object to is the harm of that content like this does to the trans community (especially trans people of color) and VERY specifically Black trans women.\u201d\n\nField was later suspended, along with two other employees, for attempting to attend an online meeting of top executives, according to reports. But she was reinstated after Netflix found that a director had shared a link to the meeting with her, implying that it was okay to attend.\n\nSeveral things can be true. Netflix is an incredible, life changing company. And Netflix fucked up majorly. But this is a watershed moment \u2014 as Netflix employees we have both the privilege and responsibility to create change on and off the platform. #NetflixWalkout \u2014 Dana Herlihey (@danaherlihey) October 20, 2021\n\nSoon after, Netflix\u2019s trans employee resource group began organizing a walkout. But B. Pagels-Minor, the organizer of the walkout and global lead of both the Black and Trans employee resource groups, was fired on Friday. Their termination sparked more backlash against Netflix.\n\n\u201cWe have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,\u201d a Netflix representative told TechCrunch last week. \u201cWe understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch was able to reach B. Pagels-Minor, but they did not offer a comment.\n\nThe leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on \u201cThe Closer\u201d that appeared in a story by Bloomberg, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham\u2019s recent comedy special \u201cInside\u201d and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Netflix\u2019s best-ever debut.\n\nNetflix told TechCrunch that the employee admitted to sharing the content externally. But Pagels-Minor\u2019s lawyer told The New York Times this week that \u201cB. categorically denies leaking sensitive information to the press.\u201d A former Netflix employee with knowledge of the situation told TechCrunch that they highly doubt that Pagels-Minor leaked these documents, as they had both been critical of the leaks in public company chats.\n\nNetflix told TechCrunch that its internal access logs showed that only one person viewed sensitive data about the titles mentioned in the Bloomberg article."}
