We even noted during Samsara\u2019s IPO pricing run that it felt like no one was paying attention:\n\nOne more note before we can sign off on this topic for the day: Doesn\u2019t it feel like a somewhat muted day for a decacorn IPO? Samsara raised venture rounds through a Series F! And yet this IPO feels like it\u2019s skating right under the radar.\n\nAt the time, we hypothesized that NFT hype was consuming all the oxygen in the room, or that there were so many IPOs that year that it was just not as exciting as before. Ah, what a good problem to have!\n\nSamsara\u2019s late-2021 IPO set it up to raise capital and go public at a valuation that made little to no sense. We saw that happen to a number of other companies that went public in 2021.\n\nHowever, Samsara priced at $23 per share, the top end of its IPO price range. Today, the company is worth $27.13 per share. That\u2019s different.\n\nBack when Samsara filed its S-1, we had to work a little to understand its business. So, to recap: The company collects data from first- and third-party IoT devices, which is then processed (made accessible via APIs) and then offered up through different applications. The company monitors work sites, corporate vehicles and physical locations.\n\nHow has the company fared since it went public?\n\nIn the company\u2019s last reported quarter before it went public (the three months ended October 30, 2021), Samsara had revenue of $113.8 million, ARR of $492.8 million and persistent free cash flow of negative $40 million per quarter.\n\nFast-forward to its first quarter ended April 29, 2023, Samsara had ARR of $856.2 million and a free cash flow margin of just -1%. The company beat analysts\u2019 consensus expectations for both revenue and forecast on the back of a 43% rise in revenue and a 41% increase in ARR, making investors happy and seeing its stock rise.\n\nBut how is Samsara growing at such a clip despite the generally uncomfortable macroeconomic climate?\n\nApparently, the company has stuck to a subscription model instead of the more trendy consumption-based pricing that has become commonplace at software companies in recent years. More importantly, Samsara prices its \u201csubscriptions based on a customer\u2019s number of physical assets\u201d instead of their headcount \u2014 the latter is what we see often in the SaaS world. Samsara said that model leads to \u201clower risk of ACV contraction if our customers\u2019 hiring slows or contracts.\u201d\n\nGiven the sheer number of layoffs we\u2019ve been seeing in the tech world, that\u2019s not a point to miss.\n\nI asked Samsara\u2019s CEO Biswas how the company is managing to keep revenue steady and rising in a worsening economy. Here\u2019s a transcript from that bit of our conversation:\n\nWouldn\u2019t people turn off some devices or pull back some trucks or run fewer transit devices? It seems like you\u2019ve got the same macro climate as anyone else, but it\u2019s steadier for you? Our customers, if you think about who we\u2019re serving, it\u2019s the garbage company, the waste management companies, the construction business and so on. When they own an asset, they utilize it. These are expensive pieces of equipment, right? They don\u2019t turn on and turn off the way that your software gets turned on and turned off. And they have a pretty good sense of what they\u2019re trying to use in the field. We\u2019re very much tied to that. And our contracts are three- to five-year term licenses. So it\u2019s actually more similar to how SaaS was sold five or 10 years ago.\n\nAnother alluring part of the Samsara resilience story revolves around whom the company sells to. Alex Zukin, an analyst at Wolfe Research asked how the company has managed \u201cacceleration at this scale\u201d in its recent quarter. Was it a lot of sales reps ramping? Did a new geography open things up for the company?\n\nSamsara\u2019s CFO Dominic Phillips responded:\n\nWe\u2019re selling into a little bit of a different budget here. We\u2019re selling into the operations budget for our customers, which tend to be pretty large and less discretionary than maybe some other budget categories.\n\nIn fewer words: Samsara caters to a more stable demand base (assets, not headcount) and its customers have a different budget (operations, not IT) that is less likely to get slashed when the economy shudders. That combination results in growth that far outstrips what we\u2019ve seen at other public software companies in recent quarters.\n\nI brought us through all of this not to simply say, \u201cHey look, not every tech company\u2019s growth is falling off a cliff this year.\u201d Instead, I want to highlight to startup founders that breaking certain pricing and sales norms can lead to a stronger foundation for your business.\n\nMost software companies are not in the IoT market, so the direct parallels might be thin, but Samsara\u2019s pretty solid performance should get every startup questioning if the pricing trends of the last boom (usage-based pricing, for one) and sales targets are really the best, let alone the only, way to find growth."}
