He describes the new product as \u201cone-click crypto and everyday payments\u201d in a single platform, in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.\n\nThe controversial entrepreneur famously stepped down in January 2022 from the San Francisco-based company he started in 2014 after dropping out of Stanford. In recent years, Breslow has been the target of more than one investor lawsuit and faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company.\n\nBreslow acknowledges that Bolt\u2019s revenue has not been robust in recent years. But he hopes to change that with this new consumer app, which he ambitiously hopes will serve as \u201ca centralized and personalized hub for financial services.\u201d\n\nThe app at once competes with a number of other companies such as crypto exchange Coinbase, payments platform Zelle, and PayPal. Its advantage, Breslow claims, is the ability to do what all these others do from one place via mobile.\n\nFor example, the app will allow users to buy, sell, send, and receive major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Solana, and Polygon directly within the app. Users are provisioned an on-chain balance powered by Zero Hash and will be able to see their balance in real time, Breslow says.\n\n\u201cI founded Bolt 11 years ago to build the easiest app to buy, sell, and send crypto. I believe this still hasn\u2019t been done well in the marketplace. Today marks a significant day: the return of that original vision,\u201d said Breslow. \u201cWe call it \u2018Coinbase for the 99%\u2019 who may not be the most technical, but still want to participate in the buying and selling of crypto.\u201d (Bolt in 2022 paid $1.5 billion for cryptocurrency payments company Wyre. It started out as an \u201ceasy way to buy, sell, and send crypto\u201d before pivoting to build one-click checkout first.)\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

(Love.com is another startup founded by Breslow in 2023 that is focused on health and wellness. He remains its CEO.)\n\nAs Bolt doesn\u2019t offer banking services, users will have to transfer money from another bank account into this one to fund purchases with the debit card.\n\nAnd lastly, the new app also provides real-time order tracking for users \u2014 something other companies such as Klarna offer in their app, as well.\n\nThe app is available today in iOS and will soon be available in the Google Play store. Once downloaded, users will be added to a waitlist with iOS users being the first to get off the waitlist.\n\n\u201cWorking nights and weekends\u201d\n\nThe new \u201csuperapp\u201d was built within just six months, Breslow claims. Justin Grooms (Bolt\u2019s president and former interim CEO) and Kartik Ramachandran (Bolt\u2019s chief product officer) began work on the app before Breslow was reinstated. Breslow helped advise them during the months prior to his reinstatement.\n\n\u201cOur team has been working nights and weekends to get this ready in time,\u201d Breslow said. Presently, Bolt has about 140 employees.\n\nDespite lackluster revenue growth, Breslow claims that Bolt has managed to still grow in terms of users \u2014 with a two-sided network of tens of millions of U.S. shoppers and \u201chundreds\u201d of merchants such as Revolve and Kendra Scott.\n\nBolt\u2019s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reported last year.\n\n\u201cPrior to my return, our revenue did not grow much and we haven\u2019t closed as much business as we\u2019d like. We don\u2019t think the company was run as well as it could have been. And that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to change very quickly,\u201d Breslow told TechCrunch. \u201cHowever, our platform kept on enrolling shoppers and attracting network growth. When I left, it was at 10 million. Now our total shopper network is 80 million in the U.S. and even larger globally.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s hoping to turn that network into revenue for Bolt by earning money from interchange fees for every debit card transaction and charging fees for the purchase and sale of crypto.\n\n\u201cWe already have a large trove of data users have provided that has been verified and charged successfully,\u201d he said.\n\nSettling lawsuits\n\nThe fintech company last year was reportedly trying to raise $450 million in an unusually structured deal that would have valued it at $14 billion. That deal raised questions over its unusual use of $250 million in \u201cmarketing credits\u201d and lack of confirmation from an investor mistakenly identified as its lead.\n\nSome of Bolt\u2019s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbes reported, but that was voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Bolt announced in March.\n\nToday, Bolt is in \u201cearly conversations\u201d on a new round that Breslow projects could close \u201cin the mid to near future.\u201d\n\nBreslow was also previously sued by former investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan that the founder had taken out. Activant claimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debt by borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back.\n\nThe case was eventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant\u2019s shares for $37 million last year.\n\nSpeaking at Fintech Meetup in Las Vegas in March, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a tremendous amount of decline over the last three years and have been winning back the trust of judges, investigators, and our team, so it\u2019s been incredibly challenging, but it\u2019s been a remarkable learning experience,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI\u2019ve learned more in these last three years than in the 10 years prior to that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd even though it\u2019s been challenging, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunity in front of us. I feel so grateful that our company has weathered the storm.\u201d\n\nBolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout, raised around $1 billion in total venture-backed funding and at one time was valued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others."}
