What caused him to jump ship? Technical inequity in the cloud dev space, he says.\n\n\u201cInside Amazon and Azure, they manage millions of workloads with about a thousand engineers with the latest and greatest technology for security, scale and availability, while in an average enterprise every 50-odd servers require at least one engineer,\u201d Thiruvengadam told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a gap here.\u201d\n\nDuploCloud attempts to bridge this gap with tools to provision cloud infrastructure. Installed in a customer\u2019s cloud account and accessed via a dedicated portal or API, DuploCloud helps set up cloud services related to networking and security as well as databases (and more), along with compliance controls for all of these.\n\nOur primary competition stems from self-built solutions, whether they\u2019re in-house developer operations teams or professional services firms,\u201d Thiruvengadam said. \u201cWe empower developers in the organization to be able to build and operate their own infrastructure. We\u2019re a platform engineering solution that one can buy versus building it themselves and spending millions of dollars over multiple years.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

According to Thiruvengadam, annual recurring revenue has grown 700% since 2021 while DuploCloud\u2019s client base has increased to more than 100 brands.\n\n\u201cWe were founded in 2018, but really began to go to market within the past three years,\u201d he added. \u201cThis period saw an increased demand for cloud-based solutions and automation tools as businesses sought to maintain operations while transitioning to remote work environments [during the pandemic]. DuploCloud is well-positioned to navigate any slowdown in the tech sector because of our focus on automation and cost efficiency, which are crucial for companies looking to optimize expenses during economic downturns \u2026 With our revenue and the venture investment, we now have several years of runway.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s WestBridge\u2019s Sumir Chadha on why he believes DuploCloud is a wise investment: \u201cOver the past year, DuploCloud has further established itself as a driver of growth and product innovation in the DevOps space. We\u2019ve been impressed with the team\u2019s energy and commitment to helping their customers scale and succeed, and we\u2019re delighted to support the company in the next stage of their growth.\u201d\n\nDuploCloud, headquartered in San Jose, California, has a team of 72 staffers at present, and expects to hire at least 10 more people before the end of the year."}
