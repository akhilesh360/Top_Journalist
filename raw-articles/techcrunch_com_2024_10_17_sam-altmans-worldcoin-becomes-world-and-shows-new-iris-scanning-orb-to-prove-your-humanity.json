(Eye-scanning initially was seen as a way to get access to Worldcoins, though the founders say this never happened.)\n\nOpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, spends a good chunk of his time working on World, Blania told TechCrunch during a press conference, but said the two startups\u2019 missions are independent from each other. However, Blania didn\u2019t rule out that World\u2019s cryptocurrency could be incorporated into ChatGPT one day.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s a co-founder and he\u2019s been so from the beginning. So, we talk a couple times a week. He\u2019s involved in all the decisions,\u201d Blania told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cOf course, he\u2019s focused on OpenAI,\u201d Blania continued. \u201cHow tied is World\u2019s success to OpenAI? I think actually not at all. I think these are two very separate missions, and I think AI is heading where it\u2019s heading, and we think what we built here is very important infrastructure for the world, and that will not change.\u201d\n\nWorld executives, who would like to scan your eyeball, during a press conference.

Its solution is \u201chuman verification services\u201d based around blockchain. The startup also promises to make the benefits of AI accessible to everyone, potentially by redistributing the wealth generated by AI to people through its Worldcoins.\n\nIf all this sounds a bit dubious, you\u2019re not the only one who thinks so. Governments around the world \u2014 including Kenya and countries in the EU \u2014 have probed and suspended Worldcoin over the years over privacy, security, and financial concerns. The Kenya investigation concluded, allowing World to continue operating, but some of those EU investigations are ongoing, and World\u2019s fate there remains uncertain.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The first and second steps \u2014 developing the Orb and building a distributed ownership network with blockchain \u2014 are already done, Blania said. The last step is redistributing the benefits of AI, but before we get to that, we have to complete the third step: scale. World had several announcements on Thursday, including the launch of a new blockchain and a new app, but they all revolved around scaling up the company\u2019s 7 million verified humans to something much larger.\n\nIn order to do that, the World team needs to scan more eyeballs across the globe. And to that end, Tools for Humanity unveiled its next-generation Orb on Thursday. The startup promised everyone (including TechCrunch) attending the live event would receive an Orb to take home, though it\u2019s not immediately clear how individuals would put it to use.\n\nThe new Orb.

Tools for Humanity says people will soon be able to verify themselves at coffee shops, and announced a partnership with the No. 1 delivery service in Latin America, Rappi, so people can schedule a home Orb verification.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Tools for Humanity unveiled Deep Face, an attempt to combat online deepfakes and impersonation using the company\u2019s human-verification services. The startup said Deep Face could be used to augment apps like FaceTime, Zoom, and X but provided no details on how that would happen.\n\nThe startup announced a beta of its World ID credential, an alternative to government IDs for use online. They aren\u2019t meant to replace national IDs, an executive clarified during a press conference, but could let people verify their identities online without giving up too much extraneous information, like they might by uploading a driver\u2019s license or passport.\n\nAdoption may be an obstacle for the World project moving forward. At the event, Tools for Humanity asked guests to verify their own identity by presenting their government-issued ID. Trusting a cryptocurrency company with your identity is a big ask for most people, but especially one led by Sam Altman, who has been accused of lying to OpenAI\u2019s board.\n\nCorrection: Tools for Humanity is the startup behind the project, World. A previous version of this story did not make clear that World is not a startup, itself."}
