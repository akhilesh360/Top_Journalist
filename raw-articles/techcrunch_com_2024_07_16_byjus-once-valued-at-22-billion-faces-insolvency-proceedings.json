The ruling effectively installs an interim resolution professional who will manage the company\u2019s operations, pushing the startup\u2019s founder out.\n\nThe National Company Law Tribunal\u2019s ruling (PDF) came in response to a petition from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which is seeking to recover nearly $19 million from the Bengauluru-headquartered edtech startup. Byju\u2019s had previously sponsored the Indian cricket team.\n\nThe tribunal has invited creditors, employees and vendors to file claims against the embattled firm. \u201cThe existence of a debt and a default in the payment of debt is clearly established,\u201d the court stated.\n\nByju\u2019s can appeal the decision and has said it wishes to \u201creach an amicable settlement with BCCI.\u201d A Byju\u2019s spokesperson added: \u201cIn the meantime, our lawyers are reviewing the order and will take necessary steps to protect the company\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nThe court order is the latest of a long series of crises that have engulfed Byju\u2019s over the past two years. The company\u2019s troubles began to surface when it missed financial reporting deadlines two years ago and fell short of revenue projections by more than 50%.\n\nThe edtech startup is mired in governance issues, its top investors, including Prosus and Peak XV, have alleged. The investor group is also separately legally fighting with Byju\u2019s and seeking the removal of its founder, Byju Raveendran. The startup\u2019s board members and auditor resigned in protest last year.\n\nThe fight between the investor group, which includes Sofina and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, escalated earlier this year after Byju\u2019s reduced the company\u2019s valuation to a mere $25 million to raise capital via a rights issue.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
