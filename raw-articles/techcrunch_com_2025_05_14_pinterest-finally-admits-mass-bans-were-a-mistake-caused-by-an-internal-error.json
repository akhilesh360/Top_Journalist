In posts published to social media on Tuesday, the company took responsibility for the issue, saying that an \u201cinternal error\u201d led to some users\u2019 accounts mistakenly being deactivated.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t share more details about what caused the error, though many have wondered if the bans were driven by an overreliance on AI-powered moderation. Reached for comment, Pinterest said the error was not due to AI moderation and that it has now resinstated the accounts that were mistakenly deactivated.\n\nThe problems have led to unrest and anger among Pinterest\u2019s user community. People complained that the company ignored their concerns and said it wasn\u2019t being transparent about the problem or how it was being addressed.\n\nFor weeks, Pinterest users have been reporting the mass bans in the comment sections of Pinterest\u2019s social media posts, on the Pinterest subreddit, and elsewhere. Reddit users, for instance, regularly complained the deactivations and removals made no sense, as their actions and posts didn\u2019t violate Pinterest\u2019s policies. In a pinned megathread on Reddit, users lamented the sudden loss of their Pins and Boards without reason, while others responded more in anger and frustration.\n\nOne group of users even threatened legal action over the mass bans. Some suggested targeting Pinterest CEO Bill Ready and other execs on LinkedIn with their complaints.\n\nAll the while, Pinterest didn\u2019t officially comment on the matter until May 1, when it posted on X that \u201cwe hear your concerns about the recent account deactivations.\u201d However, the company also stated it monitors its platform regularly for content that violates its Community Guidelines. In other words, it refused to admit the problem was real.\n\nInstead, Pinterest requested users send a DM if they believed their account was deactivated in error, as if the bans were so few and far between that they could be handled as one-offs.\n\nThings have now changed with Pinterest\u2019s new statement, though many users complain it\u2019s \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d\n\nOn May 13, Pinterest posted on X and in Instagram\u2019s comments that some users\u2019 accounts were deactivated by mistake.\n\nThe statement read:\n\nWe\u2019re committed to making Pinterest the safest, most positive place on the internet, which means setting a high bar for content safety and continually striving to meet it. We recently took action on violations of our content policies, but an internal error led to over-enforcement and some accounts were mistakenly deactivated. We\u2019re sorry for the frustration this caused. We\u2019ve reinstated many impacted accounts and are making improvements to respond faster when mistakes happen going forward. Thanks for your patience as we work to make this right for all our users.\n\nPinterest users responded to the statement in anger, listing their numerous complaints. Some users said they appealed their bans over email and received no help. Others believed Pinterest\u2019s AI had misidentified their posts. Many users said they had done nothing that should have led to a ban and were never given a clear reason for their account deactivation.\n\nUpdated after publication to note Pinterest\u2019s comment around AI."}
