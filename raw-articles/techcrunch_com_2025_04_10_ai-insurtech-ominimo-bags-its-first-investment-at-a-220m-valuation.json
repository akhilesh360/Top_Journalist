Here\u2019s an answer from one insurance startup out of Poland called Ominimo: make pay competitive, but more importantly, give those engineers the license to apply their talent and reinvent how the field works.\n\nLaunched on a bootstrapped budget just 12 months ago, Ominimo believes it\u2019s found a different and better approach to understanding and pricing risk. The company says it\u2019s already profitable and growing fast, with 300,000 policies signed up in its first market of Hungary. Now, to fuel its next stage of life, it\u2019s taking its first outside investment from a strategic backer, Zurich Insurance Group.\n\nTechCrunch understands from sources that Zurich is making a \u20ac10 million (around $11 million) equity investment for 5% of the company, valuing Ominimo at \u20ac200 million ($220 million). Neither Ominimo nor Zurich commented on the amount invested, but both have confirmed the valuation.\n\nOminimo has raised funding at a time when one of the most well-known and well-capitalized insurance startups in Europe \u2014 the once-unicorn WeFox \u2014 is selling off parts of its business and picking up lifeline financing to stay afloat.\n\nWeFox serves as both a cautionary tale about how to grow an insurance business, but also a clear opportunity. Arguably the reason WeFox grew so fast was because of demand in the market (both from consumers and investors) \u2014 a startup only had to surf that wave without wiping out.\n\nOminimo is already profitable, but it\u2019s arguably a modest effort. Today the startup is active in just one market, Hungary, and focuses only on one kind of insurance, car insurance for consumers. The plan is to replicate its model in more geographies and categories.\n\nThe company plans to expand into more than 10 new markets, starting with Poland, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Zurich Insurance will serve as its risk carrier, and Ominimo will operate as a broker, specifically a managing general agent, for Zurich. The startup is focusing initially on automotive insurance, but intends to add property insurance over time as well.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nDusan Komar, Ominimo\u2019s CEO who co-founded the company with Dennis Weinbender (now chief pricing and data officer) and Laslo Horvath (CTO), saw the challenges the insurance industry faced firsthand when he worked for McKinsey. Major insurance firms, he said, were stuck because of three main issues: rigid legacy systems that were challenging, if not impossible, to use to launch new services quickly or work with newer innovations like AI-based pricing; slow decision-making processes at the corporate level; and talent.\n\n\u201cNo brilliant software engineer or data scientist dreams of working for an insurance company,\u201d he said.\n\nMcKinsey and others like it typically get called in to try to fix all three at once. Komar and his team would build new products from the ground up and \u201chand over the code\u201d to the insurance client. \u201cIt worked to some extent, but not as perfectly as we would have hoped,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking a cue from the worlds of fintech and other insurance startups, Komar and his two co-founders saw an opportunity to develop a product as their own company rather than for a client. They would use APIs to plug in features and functionality from other providers that they might not build themselves, and that is how Ominimo was born.\n\nOminimo is essentially applying some AI-based reasoning around big-data analytics. When building and pricing an insurance quote, a traditional insurance company might use five or six main parameters (age, economic bracket, type of vehicle, past driving history, or location of car) to determine a price. A newer insurer might add another 10 or 15 parameters to that.\n\n\u201cBut there are some not-so-obvious variables that are actually super important,\u201d Komar said. For instance, once you get the license plate of a vehicle, you can tap into a database, he said, which gives you 100 different variables about the vehicle, including the length, height, width, and weight of the vehicle. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, for instance, to see that data shows a very strong correlation between the length of the car and the frequency of accidents during parking,\u201d he said.\n\nOminimo takes all of these details, plus population density and more, into account to perform its calculations.\n\nThere are, of course, a lot of insurance startups in the market already that tout the use of AI across their platforms, both for decision-making in the back-end and to improve customer experience at the front-end. Ditto the existence of dozens of startups in fintech that also lay claim to being built on AI.\n\nKomar\u2019s response to this is that Ominimo\u2019s track record speaks for itself. \u201cI think what really matters is actually performance in the market, so if you compare our performance to Lemonade\u2019s [a key competitor], you will actually see the difference,\u201d he said. He claimed that Ominimo\u2019s \u201closs ratio\u201d is below the market average, and it\u2019s already picked up a market share of 7% in Hungary, the only country where it operates.\n\nAs with a lot of the neobanks in the market \u2014 fintech and insurance really do have a lot in common \u2014 many \u201cnew\u201d insurance players are doing less disruption under the hood as they are creating a more modern user experience.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between claiming to do data science in terms of risk assessment, and actually doing it,\u201d he said. Many of his startup competitors, he believes, \u201chave actually focused on superior customer experience, very nice front-ends, very lean and intuitive journeys. But there was not a lot under the hood.\u201d\n\nGiving talent a place to do the kind of work they want to be doing, he claimed, is how Ominimo has attracted and retained key people. \u201cWe have eight medalists from mathematics and physics Olympiads [prestigious competitions in these fields] among our data science team,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are really brilliant young minds who now, for the first time, get to deploy their full potential on a global scale. And this really shows in the KPIs that we see.\u201d\n\nThat is also what attracted Zurich Insurance, which is looking for more diversified ways to bring in new waves of customers.\n\n\u201cGrowing our retail business profitably is a key ambition in Zurich\u2019s 2025-2027 cycle. That is why I am delighted with DA Direkt\u2019s distribution partnership with Ominimo, which will allow us to offer innovative motor insurance solutions and expand our retail customer base in Europe, beyond the markets in which Zurich is already present,\u201d said Alison Martin, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Zurich Insurance Group, in a statement. \u201cI am also pleased we are strengthening our relationship with a minority stake in Ominimo.\u201d"}
