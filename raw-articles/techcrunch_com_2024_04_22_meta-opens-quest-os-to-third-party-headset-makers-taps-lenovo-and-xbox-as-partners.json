Three major tech players \u2014 Asus, Lenovo and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox \u2014 are the first companies to confirm they\u2019ll be developing new devices that run the software.\n\nNow called \u201cMeta Horizon OS,\u201d the open system allows developers to access technologies like eye, face, hand and body tracking and high-resolution passthrough, a popular mixed reality feature where users can still see their surroundings while wearing the headset. The company says all future headsets can connect via the Meta Quest app on iOS and Android devices.\n\nNotably, Microsoft is teaming up with Meta to build a \u201climited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox,\u201d according to the announcement. Asus and Lenovo, on the other hand, are building headsets designed for specific use cases. For instance, Asus is developing a headset dedicated to gaming whereas Lenovo wants its device to be for \u201cproductivity, learning, and entertainment.\u201d\n\nMeta Horizon OS comes at a time when the VR/AR headset wars between Meta, Apple and Sony continue to heat up. While the open operating system is certainly a strategic and interesting move for the company, the question remains if it will give Meta a leg up in the race or if the Quest-like headsets will even be popular."}
