The increased demand for DevOps platforms, tools and services, as well as the shift to remote work, are driving growth in the market.\u201d\n\nChivukula started Opsera alongside Chandra Ranganathan in 2020 after stints at Symantec, where he was a senior systems administrator, and Adobe, where he managed IT. Ranganathan met Chivukula at Symantec, but also spent several years at Uber, where he ran the ride-hailing company\u2019s global infrastructure.\n\nLike other DevOps platforms, Opsera offers a range of tools that enable developers to create, secure and deploy apps from a single pane of glass.\n\nOpsera users can provision and integrate their choice of dev tools through a self-service catalog and utility registry. And they can build dev pipelines, deploying software across public clouds, including AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform.\n\nBeyond this, Opsera offers dashboards for tracking KPIs and auditing DevOps processes for compliance and troubleshooting.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

And according to Allied Market Research, the global market for DevOps software will reach $57.90 billion by 2030, up from $6.78 billion in 2020.\n\nOpsera claims to have 25 enterprise clients in industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, finance, retail and e-commerce. Within the next year or two, the startup plans to go after public sector customers \u2014 but Chivukula declined to be more specific than that.\n\n\u201cOne of the key challenges that the DevOps platforms market faces is point solution saturation,\u201d Chivukula continued. \u201cThere are a ton of commercialized and open source products that focus on one specific problem, environment or part of the software development lifecycle. Basically, there\u2019s a lack of holistic focus \u2014 but Opsera zooms out and helps customers see the big picture.\u201d"}
