The name was not released but TechCrunch understands it may be Intel Corp. or Qualcomm Inc.\n\nEdgify\u2019s technology allows \u201cedge devices\u201d (devices at the edge of the internet) to interpret vast amounts of data, train an AI model locally and then share that learning across its network of similar devices. This then trains all the other devices in anything from computer vision, NLP, voice recognition or any other form of AI.\n\nThe technology can be applied to anything from MRI machines, connected cars, checkout lanes, mobile devices and anything that has a CPU, GPU or NPU. Edgify\u2019s technology is already being used in supermarkets, for instance.\n\nOfri Ben-Porat, CEO and co-founder of Edgify, commented in a statement: \u201cEdgify allows companies, from any industry, to train complete deep learning and machine learning models, directly on their own edge devices. This mitigates the need for any data transfer to the Cloud and also grants them close to perfect accuracy every time, and without the need to retrain centrally.\u201d\n\nMangrove partner Hans-J\u00fcrgen Schmitz, who will join Edgify\u2019s Board comments: \u201cWe expect a surge in AI adoption across multiple industries with significant long-term potential for Edgify in medical and manufacturing, just to name a few.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
