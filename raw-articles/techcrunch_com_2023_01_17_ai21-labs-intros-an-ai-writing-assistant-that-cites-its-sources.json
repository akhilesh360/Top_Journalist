Q&A coding site Stack Overflow temporarily banned users from sharing content generated by ChatGPT, saying that the AI made it too easy for users to flood the site with spammy answers. Then, New York City public schools prohibited students and teachers from using ChatGPT on school-owned devices over fears of cheating and misinformation.\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps why AI21 Labs, an Israeli startup developing text-generating AI systems along the lines of ChatGPT, tried a different tack with its newly released assistive writing tool, Wordtune Spices. A part of AI21\u2019s expanding suite of generative AI, Wordtune Spices doesn\u2019t compose emails and essays like ChatGPT. Instead, it suggests options that change the voice and style of already written sentences, also offering up statistics from web-based sources to \u201cstrengthen arguments.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see new amazing AI capabilities introduced on a weekly basis \u2014 [AI systems] that generate images, audio and text in a convincing human-seeming manner,\u201d Ori Goshen, the co-CEO and co-founder of AI21 Labs, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cWith all the excitement, for these systems to become useful, they need to be robust, reliable and explainable.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Wordtune Spices cites its work for each tidbit of information it profers, providing users with links back to the original sources. That\u2019s one better than ChatGPT, which doesn\u2019t always \u2014 or correctly \u2014 name sources, and even sometimes points to sources that don\u2019t actually exist.\n\nAI21 says it developed \u201cgrounding and attribution\u201d algorithms to search for relevant sources to base Wordtune Spices\u2019 responses on and present the source links alongside info. The tool can help write a thesis statement and main ideas, including explanations and counterarguments, as well as provide analogies and creative expressions like jokes and quotes.\n\nUsers can choose from different cues (e.g. \u201clegal,\u201d \u201chealth care\u201d) to prompt Wordtune Spices to suggest rewrites appropriate for particular professional documents. But Goshen says that Spices was designed to address a wide array of use cases, from writing essays and working on blog posts to drafting financial reports.\n\n\u201cSpices isn\u2019t a tool that generates a full essay with one click, because we don\u2019t think this helps create strong writers,\u201d Goshen said. \u201cInstead, we equip the user with a toolbox of language and storytelling tools for them to craft their text to perfection by making decisions on their own from a host of possibilities.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Grammarly offers style and tone suggestions. So does Ginger, ProWritingAid and Slick Write.\n\nThis reporter wasn\u2019t able to test Spices prior to its release due to technical issues on AI21\u2019s end. But from a brief demo video, the rewriting feature appeared to work well enough, minus the occasional grammatical error. To follow the sentence \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that artificial intelligence tools have become one of the latest trends in content writing, blogging and copywriting as a whole,\u201d Spices suggested \u201cSome people, like content writers, may be scared of AI, but it can help you create high-quality content with a minimum of effort [sic].\u201d\n\nSpices cited an article from The New York Times in suggesting the sentence, but Goshen admits that there might be cases where the tool \u201c[misses] information that should have been validated.\u201d He also stressed that, while there are filters and \u201cother measures\u201d in place to try to prevent Spices from outputting toxic or biased text \u2014 a problem for text-generating tools like ChatGPT \u2014 the model might \u201cmake mistakes\u201d all the same.\n\n\u201cWe have been working on smart filters and other measures \u2026 We also tried to preemptively block any trolling attempts in that regard,\u201d Goshen added. \u201cThat being said, Spices isn\u2019t bulletproof, especially because it\u2019s hard to train a [system] to make sensitive decisions that sometimes even humans struggle with.\u201d\n\nGoshen says that AI21 plans to put \u201ca lot of focus\u201d on moderation and \u201cmake it more robust\u201d as Spices evolves. But for AI-curious writers holding out for the perfect system, Spices probably isn\u2019t it \u2014 even if it works roughly as advertised."}
