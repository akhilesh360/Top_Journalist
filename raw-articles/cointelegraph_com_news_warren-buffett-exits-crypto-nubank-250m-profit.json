The final tranche of 40.2 million shares was sold in the first quarter of 2025 at an average price of $11.83.\n\nThese transactions culminated in a total gain of about $250 million from the initial investment.\n\nNU doing well without Buffett\n\nBuffett\u2019s divestment from Nu Holdings further follows the latter\u2019s impressive earnings in recent quarters.\n\nIn Q1 2025, the firm reported a net income of $557.2 million, marking a 47% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. Adjusted net income reached $606.5 million, reflecting a 37% year-over-year growth.\n\nIn 2024, Nu Holdings achieved an annual net income of $1.97 billion, representing a 91% increase from 2023, indicating that Berkshire\u2019s decision to liquidate NU shares entirely was not about its performance.\n\nNU weekly performance chart.

In Q1 2025, it also sold off Citigroup and cut its Bank of America stake, unloading over $2.1 billion in shares.\n\nThese moves pushed Berkshire\u2019s cash reserves to a record $347.8 billion, with $305.5 billion in short-term US Treasurys.\n\nNubank has been among the most active digital banks embracing crypto services in Brazil, offering trading in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), and other top cryptocurrencies directly through its app.\n\nRelated: Berkshire-backed Nubank adds ADA, NEAR, ATOM to crypto offerings\n\nIn 2022, the neobank allocated 1% of its net assets to BTC, furthering Buffett\u2019s indirect exposure to Bitcoin despite his criticism toward the cryptocurrency, which he once called a \u201crat poison squared.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
