The company is based out of Riyadh and its clients include Hala, Thmanyah, the Saudi Venture Capital Company, Mozn, Jeeny, Rabbit. Schrems says the HR-tech startup has experienced great growth since launch, doubling its annual recurring revenue (ARR) every six months.\n\nFollowing this growth, it is planning on expanding to Egypt and the UAE, while doubling down on Saudi Arabia, against the backdrop of $5 million pre-Series A funding it has raised, in a round led by Europe-based VC Speedinvest, which marked its debut into Saudi Arabia, and RAED Ventures, with participation from MENA-focused VC firm Wamda Capital.\n\n\u201cWe are on a mission to transform HR tech and employee experience across the Middle East and North Africa, and ideally beyond\u2026by creating a mobile first experience,\u201d said Schrems.\n\nPhilip Specht, partner at Speedinvest, said in a statement: \u201cAs EU-based investors, we have seen how companies such as Personio and Factorial are creating billion dollar outcomes in the HR space. With a similar, but localized approach, we believe that Palm.hr is poised to become the leading player in the MENA region, and the wider Arab world. The company has an outstanding team, a superior value proposition in terms of features, integrations and UX, and strong customer love. We are thrilled to back Palm.hr, which reflects our excitement about the wider start-up ecosystem in the MENA.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It also automates other workflow functions related to HR, including on- or off-boarding employees, and is configurable across borders, making it easy for it to match local labor laws and employee regulations in different markets.\n\nFor instance, in Saudi Arabia, Palm.hr has integrated with government services such as Mudad for digital payroll and compliance, mandated by the country\u2019s ministry of labor; the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI), and Muqeem, the foreign employee\u2019s data platform.\n\n\u201cWith Palm.hr, you can fully process your payroll, you can actually do the payments because we are integrated with the government payroll system; apply for visas because we are integrated with the government visa system, and update people\u2019s social insurance because we\u2019re integrated with the social insurance system,\u201d said Schrems.\n\nThe company is also set to add new features and products that will, for instance, make it possible for employees to easily access loans, asset-financing, and insurance products.\n\n\u201cWe want to merge HR-tech with fintech and insurtech\u2026for employees to be able to do everything like purchase or rent assets, sign up to health or travel insurance, within our solution. We want to make Palm.hr part of employees\u2019 daily lives,\u201d said Schrems.\n\nAs it embarks on expansion and more product development, Palm.hr hopes to capture a sizable portion of the global HR tech market, which is envisaged to grow at 9.08% CAGR to reach $53.3 billion by 2028."}
