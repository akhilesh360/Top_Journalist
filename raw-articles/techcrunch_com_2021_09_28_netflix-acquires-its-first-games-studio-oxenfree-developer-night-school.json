This makes it the first games studio the streaming giant has purchased.\n\nIn Netflix\u2019s announcement, Mike Verdu, vice president of game development, wrote Night School\u2019s \u201ccommitment to artistic excellence and proven track record make them invaluable partners as we build out the creative capabilities and library of Netflix games together.\u201d He added that Netflix plans to add \u201cexclusive games designed for every kind of gamer and any level of play\u201d that will be included with its membership and have no ads or in-app purchases.\n\nNight School Studio was founded in 2014 by Sean Krankel, a former senior game designer at Disney Interactive, and Adam Hines, who was a lead writer at Telltale Games. (Telltale Games was a Netflix partner, working on interactive shows like \u201cMinecraft: Storymode\u201d adventure before shutting down).\n\nIn a statement on Night School\u2019s site, Krankel wrote \u201cNetflix gives film, TV and now game makers an unprecedented canvas to create and deliver excellent entertainment to millions of people. Our explorations in narrative gameplay and Netflix\u2019s track record of supporting diverse storytellers was such a natural pairing.\u201d\n\nFor fans of Oxenfree and other Night School titles, Krankel reassured them that it will keep working on Oxenfree II and \u201ccooking up new game worlds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Netflix team has shown the utmost care for protecting our studio culture and creative vision,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The next year, it took the format to content for adult viewers with the \u201cBandersnatch\u201d episode of \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Since then, it\u2019s added other interactive children\u2019s shows like \u201cMinecraft: Story Mode,\u201d and \u201cEmily\u2019s Wonder Lab.\u201d"}
