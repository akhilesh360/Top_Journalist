The Authentics 200, Authentics 300 and Authentics 500, all of which sport automatic self-tuning, Bluetooth and multiroom playback, will be available starting on September 17.\n\nFor years, Google has resisted enabling manufacturers \u2014 outside of Sonos, at least \u2014 to build smart devices featuring both Google Assistant and Alexa.\n\nThat\u2019s led Amazon to ramp up the pressure \u2014 not necessarily out of a sense of altruism, but to level what it perceived as an uneven playing field.\n\nWhile Alexa has a respectable install base \u2014 about 500 million devices as of early this year \u2014 Google\u2019s long benefited from shipping Google Assistant as the default assistant on Android smartphones. (This preferential treatment was once the subject of an EU antitrust investigation.) In 2019, Google said that Google Assistant was available on more than 1 billion devices.\n\nSo in 2019, Amazon launched the Voice Interoperability Initiative, a program aimed at ensuring voice-enabled products such as smart speakers, smartphones and smart displays let users choose among multiple voice assistants. Google, along with Samsung and Apple, declined to join. But now the search giant\u2019s changing its tune.\n\nWhy? In an email interview, Marissa Chacko, director of product management of Google Assistant, glossed over Amazon and Google\u2019s contemptuous history and seemed to say, in so many words, \u201cwhy not?\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\n\u201cVoice assistants have become part of our everyday lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth Google and Amazon wanted to make it easy for users to access either of these voice services simultaneously \u2026 We aren\u2019t trying to compensate for capability gaps, but rather give users choice.\u201d\n\nOn the new JBL Authentics speakers, Google Assistant and Alexa will work interchangeably. Users will be able to ask Alexa to set a timer, for example, and, when it rings, ask Google Assistant to stop it (and vice versa).\n\nThat\u2019s thanks to what Amazon calls universal device commands (UDC), functionality driven by Amazon\u2019s Multi-Agent Experience Toolkit, which was borne out of the Voice Interoperability Initiative. With UDC, a user can ask Alexa and Google Assistant to stop certain tasks \u2014 like music, timers, reminders and alarms \u2014 without having to remember which assistant started the request or ask for the request to be handed off to the other assistant.\n\nPerhaps just as importantly, the assistants won\u2019t try to speak over one another. The Authentics speakers will automatically change the \u201caudio focus\u201d in the appropriate moment to prevent, for instance, Alexa from speaking over a Google Assistant timer.\n\nAmazon and Google have been testing UDC during beta trials, Aaron Rubenson, VP of Alexa, told me via email.\n\n\u201cCustomers might prefer to access Alexa or Google Assistant to use their favorite Amazon and Google services,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might ask Google Assistant for a good substitute for milk, and then ask Alexa to buy it from Amazon.com. Or, get an Amazon package delivery notification from Alexa, and then ask Google Assistant to add a reminder about the delivery to your Google Calendar.\u201d\n\nBut aren\u2019t Google and Amazon concerned about engagement with either Google Assistant or Alexa suffering now that both assistants are on one device? Apparently, no. In a remarkable change in tune, Rubenson and Chacko say that they see the assistants as being \u201ccomplementary\u201d rather than competitive with each other.\n\n\u201cWhile we of course want to increase engagement with Alexa, the focus of this integration is to create a great customer experience where customers have seamless access to both assistants,\u201d Rubenson said. \u201cWe fully expect customers to use Alexa and Google Assistant on their own or alongside each other on the JBL Authentics 200, 300, and 500 speakers.\u201d\n\nChacko added: \u201cWe believe in creating a strong smart home ecosystem, and ultimately want to make it easier for people to have access to their preferred assistants \u2026 We know that many households have mixed voice assistant preferences and several devices, which can be difficult to manage. Along with Amazon and Harman, we had a shared vision for this integration to provide users value and choice by delivering simultaneous access to multiple voice assistants on a single device.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s important subtext.\n\nSmart speaker sales have been in decline for some time. Shipments were down 30% in Q1 2023, the sixth quarterly consecutive dip. And according to a survey by UpCity, a business-to-business service directory, only half of U.S. consumers are using voice search daily.\n\nThe stakes are lower than they used to be, simply put \u2014 especially in light of both Amazon and Google internally scaling back their voice assistant efforts.\n\nAmazon was reportedly on pace to lose about $10 billion on Alexa and other devices in 2022 alone. And Google has ramped down its investments in Google Assistant both for third-party devices and its own hardware lineup, recently stripping third-party voice games and apps from Nest hub smart displays.\n\nDeclining sales likely aren\u2019t the only reason to blame for the shifting corporate priorities. As it turns out, it\u2019s hard to make money with voice assistants. Amazon is said to have raked in less than $2 million on Alexa apps in 2019, falling well short of the company\u2019s $5 million target.\n\nBut be all this as it may, the Harman/Amazon collaboration could end up being a one-off. Chacko wouldn\u2019t commit to future Google Assistant and Alexa integrations, implying that it\u2019ll depend on how this one\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s early to determine this integration\u2019s impact,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t have any plans to share about future integrations, we\u2019re excited to see how \u2026. [users] utilize having simultaneous access to both Google Assistant and Alexa at home.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a temporary alliance \u2014 not a lasting truce."}
