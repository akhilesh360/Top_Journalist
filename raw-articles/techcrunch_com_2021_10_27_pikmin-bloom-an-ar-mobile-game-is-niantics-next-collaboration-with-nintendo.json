The free game was first released for iOS and Android in Singapore and Australia, but rolled out in the United States on Thursday morning. Pikmin Bloom is expected to release globally in the coming days.\n\nLike Pok\u00e9mon Go, Pikmin Bloom will encourage players to get outside and explore their neighborhoods. Only now, instead of catching Pidgey and Rattata, you\u2019ll collect seedlings and create a squad of Pikmin. The more you walk, the more Pikmin you\u2019ll collect. These plant-animal hybrid creatures come from Nintendo\u2019s strategy and puzzle game franchise of the same name.\n\nPikmin Bloom marks the sixth installment in the Pikmin video game series. There are many different types of Pikmin to interact with, and as you walk alongside them, you\u2019ll leave augmented reality trails of flowers behind you. According to in-game footage in the announcement video (seen above), it looks like you can customize your avatar as a Mii.\n\nAnother feature that borrows from Pok\u00e9mon Go is Pikmin Bloom\u2019s monthly Community Day events. In the former, players are lured outdoors with special bonuses and rare featured Pok\u00e9mon once per month, encouraging people to get outside and befriend fellow players. Niantic hasn\u2019t released details, but the company said that it will host monthly Community Day events for Pikmin as well to plant and play together.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But Pikmin seems more specifically geared toward encouraging movement, showing the routes you walked and the steps you took at the end of every day.\n\nThe last time the two companies released a game together, it shattered expectations \u2014 so, no pressure to our floral friends. Even if Pok\u00e9mon Go doesn\u2019t feel as ubiquitous as it did in summer 2016, it\u2019s making Niantic more money than ever, netting over $1 billion in 2020. But it doesn\u2019t quite seem like there\u2019s as much to do yet in Pikmin Bloom as there is in Pok\u00e9mon Go or Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. So, this game might be geared toward a more casual crowd who just want to see some pretty pixels while they walk \u2014 no shiny-hunting and raid battle coordination here \u2026 at least not yet.\n\nUpdate 10/28/21, 10:20 AM EST: The game is now available in the United States."}
