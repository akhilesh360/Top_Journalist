The phrase is an internal mantra at Bison, the early-stage venture firm betting on \u201cfrontier tech\u201d companies building in the material science, robotics, biotech, climate, and sustainability verticals; one that\u2019s meant to dissuade founders from solving the problem they think exists.\n\nBison\u2019s mantra, according to Biegala, \u201chammers home the point that if these entrepreneurs aren\u2019t talking to customers and validating their hypothesis around the pain point, around the value proposition, around the product specs, that\u2019s a major, major red flag for us.\u201d\n\nSo how can founders scale frontier tech? Today on Equity, Rebecca Bellan asks Biegala and his co-founder Ben Hemani for specifics.\n\nListen to the full episode to hear Rebecca and Bison\u2019s founding team discuss:\n\nWhy AI isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for biotech companies, although it is central to modern drug discovery.\n\nWhich robotics startups are catching investors\u2019 eyes.\n\nHow \u2014 and how not \u2014 to find product-market fit when building frontier technology.\n\nWhen to seek out venture funding over grant funding.\n\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.
