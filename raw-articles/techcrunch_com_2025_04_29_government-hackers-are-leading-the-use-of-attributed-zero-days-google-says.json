But the report noted that of the proportion of zero-days that Google could attribute \u2014 meaning identifying the hackers who were responsible for exploiting them \u2014 at least 23 zero-day exploits were linked to government-backed hackers.\n\nAmong those 23 exploits, 10 zero-days were attributed to hackers working directly for governments, including five exploits linked to China and another five to North Korea.\n\nAnother eight exploits were identified as having been developed by spyware makers and surveillance enablers, such as NSO Group, which typically claim to only sell to governments. Among those eight exploits made by spyware companies, Google is also counting bugs that were recently exploited by Serbian authorities using Cellebrite phone-unlocking devices.\n\nA chart showing the zero-day exploits that were attributed in 2024.
