Basically, it\u2019s creating QR codes that can flag and identify how different protein receptors in cells respond to chemicals. These are the biological sensors which help control everything from immune responses to the senses of sight and smell, the firing of neurons; even the release of hormones and communications between cells in the body are regulated.\n\n\u201cOur discovery platform was designed to map and measure the interconnected relationships between chemicals, multiple drug receptor pathways and diseases, enabling us to engineer multi-targeted drugs in a more rational way, across a wide spectrum of targets,\u201d said Sri Kosuri, Octant\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\nOctant\u2019s work is based on a technology first developed at the University of California Los Angeles by Kosuri and a team of researchers, which slashed the cost of making genetic sequences to $2 per gene from $50 to $100 per gene.\n\n\u201cOur method gives any lab that wants the power to build its own DNA sequences,\u201d Kosuri said in a 2018 statement. \u201cThis is the first time that, without a million dollars, an average lab can make 10,000 genes from scratch.\u201d\n\nJoining Kosuri in launching Octant is Ramsey Homsany, a longtime friend of Kosuri\u2019s, and a former executive at Google and Dropbox. Homsany happened to have a background in molecular biology from school, and when Kosuri would talk about the implications of the technology he developed, the two men knew they needed to for a company.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

So we can build these maps between chemicals and targets and pathways that are essential to drug development.\u201d\n\nBefore coming to UCLA, Kosuri had a long history with companies developing products based on synthetic biology on both the coasts. Through some initial work that he\u2019d done in the early days of the biofuel boom in 2007, Kosuri was connected with Flagship Ventures, and the imminent Harvard-based synthetic biologist George Church. He also served as a scientific advisor to Gen9, a company acquired by the multi-billion dollar synthetic biology powerhouse, Ginkgo Bioworks.\n\n\u201cSome of the most valuable drugs in history work on complex sets of drug targets, which is why Octant\u2019s focus on polypharmacology is so compelling,\u201d said Jason Kelly, the co-founder and CEO of Gingko Bioworks, and a member of the Octant board, in a statement. \u201cOctant is engineering a lot of luck and cost out of the drug discovery equation with its novel platform and unique big data biology insights, which will drive the company\u2019s internal development programs as well as potential partnerships.\u201d\n\nThe new technology arrives at a unique moment in the industry where pharmaceutical companies are moving to target treatments for diseases that are tied to specific mutations, rather than look at treatments for more common disease problems, said Homsany.\n\n\u201cPeople are dropping common disease problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest players are dropping these cases and it seems like that just didn\u2019t make sense to us. So we thought about how would a company take these new technologies and apply them in a way that could solve some of this.\u201d\n\nOne reason for the industry\u2019s turn away from the big diseases that affect large swaths of the population is that new therapies are emerging to treat these conditions which don\u2019t rely on drugs. While they wouldn\u2019t get into specifics, Octant co-founders are pursuing treatments for what Kosuri said were conditions \u201cin the metabolic space\u201d and in the \u201cneuropsychiatric space\u201d.\n\nHelping them pursue those targets, since Octant is very much a drug development company, is $30 million in financing from investors led by Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n\u201cDrug discovery remains a process of trial and error. Using its deep expertise in synthetic biology, the Octant team has engineered human cells that provide real-time, precise and complete readouts of the complex interactions and effects that drug molecules have within living cells,\u201d said Jorge Conde, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and member of the Octant board of directors. \u201cBy querying biology at this unprecedented scale, Octant has the potential to systematically create exhaustive maps of drug targets and corresponding, novel treatments for our most intractable diseases.\u201d"}
