The station is intended to operate on its own initially, but will eventually become one module in a larger Vast station when it connects with others launched later.\n\nHaven-1 is small enough that it can be launched atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and it\u2019s designed to accommodate up to four crew at once. It features a docking hatch designed for Crew Dragon, and looks to be a little over double the height of SpaceX\u2019s human-rated spacecraft.\n\nIn its initial, single-module form, the Vast station is mostly intended to provide an extended-stay destination for Dragon flights, offering four people a bit more room to stretch their legs \u2014 along with opportunity for \u201cscience, research and in-space manufacturing\u201d for stays of up to 30 days on orbit. The station also provides power, round-the-clock connectivity via onboard Wi-Fi and \u201cconsumables\u201d (a mini bar?) throughout the stay.\n\nVast-1, the mission that the company says will provide the station\u2019s first four human occupants, is actually available for booking \u2014 the company is open to both space agencies and their professional astronauts, as well as private individuals aiming to do either scientific or philanthropic work. Vast also has an option on the books with SpaceX for a second mission, Vast-2, which would fly in 2026 \u2014 I guess depending on demand?\n\nThe 2025 date, if it sticks, will beat other planned commercial space stations to operational status \u2014 including the private Starlab project by Nanoracks, Lockheed Martin and Voyager space, which is aiming for 2027, and Axiom, which is so far targeting \u201clate 2025\u201d for the launch of the first section of its planned orbital platform."}
