For those who don\u2019t choose to direct deposit, the interest rate of 2% for standard users is still competitive.\n\nBy comparison, the national average savings account yield is 0.61% APY, according to Bankrate\u2019s survey of institutions as of the week of March 24.\n\nWhile Chime Chief Product Officer Madhu Muthukumar didn\u2019t say it outright, the move appears to be one at least in part aimed at attracting more stickiness among customers. As of last summer, Chime had 7 million customers and $1.5 billion in annualized revenue, according to reporting by Forbes. The company declined to provide updated figures.\n\nIn December, Chime filed confidential paperwork to go public with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Chime was last valued at $25 billion when it raised $1 billion at the height of the valuation frenzy of 2021, and has raised $2.65 billion total, PitchBook estimates. Its investors include Forerunner Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Sequoia, SoftBank, Tiger Global, and many others.\n\nThe company also declined to comment on potential IPO timing.\n\nPremium membership required\n\nTo be eligible for the 3.7% APY, Chime customers must agree to become members of Chime+, a premium membership tier that requires the agreement to direct deposit their paychecks. There is no charge to join as a premium member.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It touts that it doesn\u2019t charge overdraft, maintenance, or low balance fees or require account minimums.\n\n\u201cThese are people who you would find in your community, whether they make a coffee in your local store, teach your children, deliver a package, or help you find something in your big box retailer,\u201d Muthukumar said.\u201d This is your neighbor.\u201d\n\nIts customer base skews slightly female, he told TechCrunch, with members more in the 30s age range as opposed to \u201csuper young folks\u201d and are \u201cgainfully employed.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Chime began offering a credit card that it claims helps users build and improve their credit by setting purchase limits based on account balance and acting more like a debit card. Now, members no longer have to direct deposit through Chime to apply for and use Chime\u2019s Credit Builder Visa credit card.\n\nOther features that Chime is announcing Monday include a redesigned app, an expanded set of \u201cdeals\u201d or discounts specifically for Chime users, cashback offers, and \u201cdedicated\u201d customer support. On March 21, it also announced a new \u201cinstant loans\u201d product.\n\nFinancial technology companies continue to get creative in attempting to woo customers. Last week, Robinhood announced that it was going to begin offering wealth management and private banking services to retail investors, touting that such services were \u201cno longer reserved for the wealthy.\u201d As part of that new offering, Robinhood says it will provide a 4% APY on savings as well as assistance with estate planning and taxes, among other things. Uniquely, it also will offer cash delivery to a user\u2019s doorstep."}
