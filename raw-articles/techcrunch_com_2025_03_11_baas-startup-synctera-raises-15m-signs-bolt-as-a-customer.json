But that hasn\u2019t stopped BaaS startup Synctera from raising another $15 million in funding, it tells TechCrunch exclusively.\n\nSynctera works to provide companies \u201cof all shapes and sizes with everything they need to launch and operate fintech and embedded banking products,\u201d including: accounts, cards, and payment products, said CEO and co-founder Peter Hazlehurst.\n\nFin Capital and Diagram co-led the Series A extension round, which brings Synctera\u2019s total equity raised since its 2020 inception to $94 million. Other existing investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, NAventures, Banco Popular, Mana Ventures, Evolution, True Equity, and 1st and Main.\n\nHazlehurst declined to reveal the company\u2019s valuation. As for business fundamentals, he said he expected the latest capital infusion to get Synctera \u201cto breakeven\u201d by early 2026.\n\nThe company saw an 80% increase in revenue and a 230% increase in gross profit year-over-year for its fiscal year ending January 31, according to Hazlehurst. Its 31 customers include one-click checkout company Bolt, Webull, Fruitful, Unified Signal, and Firstcard, among others. Synctera has 416,000 end users on its platform, which Hazlehurst said is up over 3x compared to a year ago.\n\nHe said the company\u2019s biggest differentiator lies in compliance.\n\n\u201cWhile all of our competitors similarly provide the API layer needed to launch fintech and embedded banking products, Synctera\u2019s key differentiation lies in the tools and infrastructure we offer to customers and banks to manage compliance and ongoing operations,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Hazlehurst said he\u2019s proud of the fact the company has been \u201cable to nearly 2x the business without requiring incremental staffing.\u201d\n\nThe company makes money in a variety of ways, including charging monthly platform fees, usage-based fees for ledgers and accounts, transactions, fraud monitoring and KYC/KYB (know your customer and know your business). It also gets a revenue share on interchange and interest on deposits.\n\nAs for the impact of the Synapse collapse, Hazlehurst says the debacle hurt in some ways and helped in others.\n\n\u201cWe experienced a number of fintechs coming to us looking for a solution and migration path to a new banking relationship,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cI have always built with consumers and banks in mind first and foremost. What we witnessed with Synapse and Evolve clearly didn\u2019t follow that approach, which was, and is, horrible to see the massive impact on real people and their money,\u201d he added.\n\nFrom an industry perspective, the whole situation had \u201ca pretty material impact\u201d on new fintechs being able to be funded and new banks coming into the ecosystem, in Hazlehurst\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cIt has slowed down and caused a lot more caution in the market as a whole. We certainly see more in-depth due diligence processes with new partners, banks, and customers, which I think is ultimately a good thing for consumers and the industry at large,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently Synctera also inked a strategic partnership with Hawk, a company that uses artificial intelligence to fight financial crimes such as money laundering.\n\nLooking ahead, the new funding will in part go toward expanding its sales team of three as well as toward product development, according to Hazlehurst. The startup also sees a big opportunity to expand in Latin America, where it has seen a lot of demand and has a couple of large customers."}
