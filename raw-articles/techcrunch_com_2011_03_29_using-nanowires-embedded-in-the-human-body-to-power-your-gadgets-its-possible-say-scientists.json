Their potential is only limited by one\u2019s imagination.\u201d Strong, powerful words from Dr. Zhong Lin Wang, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, whose nanogenerators could one day power a whole host of gadgets, from your iPod to your favorite tablet. The idea rests upon zinc oxide nanowires, wires that generate electricity when flexed.\n\nThe principals behind the idea aren\u2019t too hard to understand. The wires are small enough\u2014they are nanowires, after all\u2014that they could be embedded in pretty much anything. For the sake of this quick post, let\u2019s say they\u2019re embedded in your shoes. Every time you take a step, the zinc oxide nanowires generate electricity, electricity that could then be used to power whatever, depending on power requirements and electricity storage.\n\nThat not exciting enough for you? Considering there are nano wires, it\u2019s conceivable that you could have them implanted inside your body, so that, say, every time your heart beats you can power your handheld device.\n\nThe beat that your heart skips, and uses to power your iPod.\n\nThe wires are so small that 500 of them could fit in a human hair.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure Michio Kaku addressed this in his new book. I\u2019m still unarmed with the idea of contact lenses that have the Internet built into them."}
