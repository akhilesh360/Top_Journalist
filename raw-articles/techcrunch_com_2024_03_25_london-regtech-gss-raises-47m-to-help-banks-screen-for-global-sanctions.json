For its latest raise, GSS revealed another financial powerhouse as a backer: the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), which is joined by Cynosure Group and AlixPartner for this latest cash injection.\n\nBanks often find themselves at the forefront of sanctions enforcement, given their role in controlling the flow of money around the globe. But it\u2019s not always easy figuring out who is sending money to whom. In 2019, Standard Chartered was hit with $1.1 billion in fines from U.K. and U.S. regulators for having insufficient money-laundering controls in place, including breaching sanctions that had been put in place against countries such as Iran. And five years previous to that, BNP Paribas was fined a whopping $8.9 billion for processing financial transactions for countries sanctioned by the U.S.\n\nAs such, investors have continued to back regulatory compliance businesses in recent years, with the likes of New York-based Droit raising $23 million last year, shortly after London\u2019s SteelEye secured $21 million in financing.\n\nGSS sells a sanctions-screening platform to help banks and other financial institutions comply with regulations. These institutions feed transaction data into GSS\u2019s cloud-based platform, which returns an alert if it finds a match against a standardized set of sanctions lists from around the world \u2014 GSS also \u201cenriches\u201d these lists with additional data points, such as dates of birth, International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for ships and data from the local financial transfer systems of sanctioned countries such as Russia and China.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
