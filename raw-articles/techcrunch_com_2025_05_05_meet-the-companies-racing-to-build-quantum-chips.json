But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits \u2014 short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing.\n\nAs usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems.\n\nBut some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results.\n\nHere are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking.\n\nAkhetonics\n\nAkhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip \u2014 a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a \u20ac6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024.\n\nAlice & Bob\n\nAlice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a \u201cfault tolerant\u201d quantum computer.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
