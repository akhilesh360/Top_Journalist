Preorders will no longer begin on April 9.\n\n\u201cPreorders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025, in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cNintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025, is unchanged.\u201d\n\nNintendo still plans to release the console on June 5 for $450.\n\nThe company unveiled the Nintendo Switch 2 on Tuesday, which will be its first new console since the Nintendo Switch was introduced in 2017. The console will be available for purchase on its own, or with a bundle that includes Mario Kart World, a new game for the Switch 2.\n\nThe launch came the same day that Trump announced sweeping tariffs that are expected to strike a blow to the tech industry. Trump announced tariffs of around 30% on both China and Taiwan, which will likely disrupt trade flows in the tech world."}
