But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s getting easier to deploy.\n\nAccording to a 2023 S&P Global survey, about half of companies with at least one AI project in production are still at the pilot or proof-of-concept stages. The reasons for the slow ramp-ups vary, but the commonly cited ones are challenges around data management, security and compute resources.\n\nOf businesses responding to the S&P poll, around half said they aren\u2019t ready to implement AI \u2014 and won\u2019t be for five years or more.\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s an increasing number of products from startups and Big Tech vendors alike that aim to tackle these AI deployment roadblocks. (See ML Hub, Kore.ai and Viso, to name a few.) One of the newer entrants is Pienso, a platform that lets users build and deploy models without having to write code.\n\nBirago Jones and Karthik Dinakar founded Pienso in 2016 based on their research at MIT (they\u2019re alumni). The two met a few years back at MIT\u2019s Media Lab as graduate students.\n\n\u201cWe teamed up for a class project to build a tool that would help social media platforms moderate and flag bullying content,\u201d Jones, who serves as Pienso\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cThere was just one problem: While the model itself worked the way it was supposed to, it wasn\u2019t trained on the right data, so it wasn\u2019t able to identify harmful content that used teenage slang.\u201d\n\nJones and Dinakar eventually realized that the solution was to have subject-matter experts \u2014 in this case, teenagers \u2014 help train the model. They built tools for this purpose, and some years later, Jones and Dinakar teamed up to commercialize these tools.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

To be able to scale to AI\u2019s full potential, where it can manage business processes and interact with customers, you have to be able to train and fine-tune your model. Pienso believes that any domain expert, not just an AI engineer, should be able to do just that.\u201d\n\nPienso guides users through the process of annotating or labeling training data for pre-tuned open source or custom AI models. (It depends on the model, but AI generally needs labels \u2014 like an image of a bird paired with the label \u201cfinch\u201d \u2014 to learn to perform a task.) The platform, which can be deployed in the cloud or on-premises, integrates with enterprise systems through APIs. But it can also operate without APIs or third-party services, keeping data within a secure environment.\n\nSky, the U.K. broadcaster, is using Pienso to analyze customer service calls, Jones says, while an unnamed U.S. government agency has tested it to monitor illegal weapons tracking.\n\n\u201cPienso\u2019s flexible, no-code interface allows teams to train models directly using their own company\u2019s data,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis alleviates the privacy concerns of using \u2026 models, and also is more accurate, capturing the nuances of each individual company.\u201d\n\nCompanies pay Pienso a yearly license based on the number of AI models they deploy. The greater the number of models, the higher the licensing cost.\n\n\u201cWe intentionally designed our pricing to allow customers to test out models beforehand to understand how AI can help them without first having to make a sizable investment,\u201d Jones added. \u201cWe wanted to give customers the freedom to experiment with building new models before deploying them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a business model that appeals to investors, apparently. Pienso recently raised $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Latimer Ventures with participation from Gideon Capital, SRI, Uncork and Good Growth Capital.\n\nWith Pienso raising a total of $17 million, Jones says the new cash will be put toward scaling up Pienso\u2019s sales, marketing and customer success teams, recruiting engineering talent and building new features for the platform.\n\nSaid Latimer Ventures\u2019 Luke Cooper in a statement: \u201cWe constantly hear about the need to democratize AI, but what makes Pienso stand out is how they\u2019re thinking about the role of a domain expert in this equation. They\u2019re empowering those who understand their data best to get the most insights out of it. It\u2019s fostering a future where we\u2019re building smarter AI models for a specific application, by the people who are most familiar with the problems they are trying to solve.\u201d"}
