According to PitchBook, companies focused on tackling hurdles in payroll and people management and recruitment raised $12 billion last year. For example, Velocity Global, which offers a platform that handles onboarding and payroll, raised $400 million in a single funding round last year, while employee management software vendor Rippling landed $250 million.\n\nIn a sign that the enthusiasm isn\u2019t dying down, Ashby, a new recruitment platform launching out of stealth, has raised $21.5 million in equity financing. F-Prime Capital led the Series B with participation from Elad Gil, Lachy Groom, Semper Virens, Base Case Capital and Gaingels, bringing Ashby\u2019s total raised to $34.5 million.\n\nAshby was founded in 2018 by Benjamin Encz and Abhik Pramanik, who met while working together at PlanGrid, a construction productivity software startup. Prior to PlanGrid, Pramanik was an R&D engineer at Industrial Light & Magic and co-launched Choir, a mobile app designed to provide therapies to those with mental health challenges. He was also a project lead at German IT service provider Datagroup before building clinical software and processes for the Mayo Clinic.\n\nAt PlanGrid, where Encz was the director of engineering and spent the bulk of his time on recruitment and recruitment-related tasks, Encz says he ran into limitations with existing applicant tracking systems (ATS) \u2014 and was inspired to build one from scratch. It isn\u2019t just him. According to one survey, 50% of employers don\u2019t use ATS software, whether because of blockers with implementation or insufficient C-suite buy-in.\n\n\u201cRecruitment teams are being disproportionately impacted by current tech layoffs \u2014 this creates the need to run leaner budgets and do more with less headcount,\u201d Encz told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cAshby is consolidating recruitment tools for companies with double-digit employee counts. [The platform\u2019s] automation of tasks like sourcing and scheduling are big advantages for lean recruiting teams.\u201d\n\nEncz sees Ashby replacing solutions from vendors like Greenhouse and Lever with algorithms \u2014 specifically scheduling and profiling algorithms. He claims that the platform uses AI to automatically find times that work for interviewers and interviewees and infer demographic data like gender and ethnicity, which clients use for aggregate analyses of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring metrics.\n\nEncz was quick to assert that the demographic data can only be used in the aggregate and not in a way that impacts individual hiring decisions.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Hiring managers can\u2019t keep track of candidate pipeline or track DEI statistics. Ashby\u2019s platform is particularly strong in data collection, data quality, multi-departmental workflows and reporting \u2014 we have templates and custom options.\u201d\n\nThe market for recruitment software could reach reach $3.85 billion by 2028. A number of startups are competing for a slice of it, unsurprisingly, like Guide and Fletcher. Elsewhere, recruitment platform Gem gained unicorn status last September.\n\nBut Encz says that Ashby already has a number of high-profile customers, including Notion, Opendoor, FullStory and Figma, and a client base exceeding 500 brands. He declined to share revenue metrics while averring that the company is prepared for a potential slowdown, noting that Ashby intends to increase headcount from 55 employees to 75 by the end of the year.\n\nAs alluded to earlier, one factor in Ashby\u2019s favor is enduring demand for HR tech broadly speaking. The market has proven remarkably resilient in the face of both pandemic and economic headwinds, as companies invest in digital infrastructure and macroeconomic fears increase the pressure on HR teams \u2014 some of which had to contend with layoffs among their ranks \u2014 to vet candidates carefully.\n\n\u201cLast year was a huge accelerant \u2014 this year less so,\u201d Encz said. \u201cWe anticipate a potential slowdown but we are well-capitalized. The Series B was opportunistically based on strong growth and wanting to have a healthy cash reserve. In the next 12 months, will use the new injection of funding to expand Ashby\u2019s offering further beyond what is typically found in ATS, allowing us to be more aggressive on product, design and engineering hiring.\u201d"}
