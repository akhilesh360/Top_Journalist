Isomorphic will receive $45 million upfront from Eli Lilly and potentially up to $1.7 billion based on performance milestones, excluding royalties. Novartis, meanwhile, will pay $37.5 million upfront in addition to funding \u201cselect\u201d research costs and as much as $1.2 billion (once again excluding royalties) in performance-based incentives over time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to embark on this partnership and apply our proprietary technology platform,\u201d DeepMind co-founder and Isomorphic CEO Demis Hassabis said in a press release. \u201cThe focus we share on advancing groundbreaking drug design approaches and appreciation of state-of-the-art science makes [these] partnership[s] particularly compelling.\u201d\n\nFiona Marshall, president of biomedical research at Novartis, added in a statement: \u201cCutting-edge AI technologies . . . hold the potential to transform how we discover new drugs and accelerate our ability to deliver life-changing medicines for patients. This collaboration harnesses our companies\u2019 unique strengths, from AI and data science to medicinal chemistry and deep disease area expertise, to realize new possibilities in AI-driven drug discovery.\u201d\n\nIsomorphic, which Hassabis launched in 2021 under DeepMind parent company Alphabet, draws on DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold 2 AI technology that can be used to predict the structure of proteins in the human body. By uncovering these structures, the hope is that researchers can identify new target pathways to deliver drugs for fighting disease.\n\nThe tech isn\u2019t perfect. A recent article in Nature Methods pointed out that AlphaFold occasionally makes obvious mistakes and, in many cases, is more useful as a \u201chypothesis generator\u201d rather than a replacement for experimental data. But the scale at which the model can generate reasonably accurate protein predictions is beyond most methods that came before.\n\nResearchers recently used AlphaFold to design and synthesize a potential drug to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of primary liver cancer. And DeepMind is collaborating with Geneva-based Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, a nonprofit pharmaceutical organization, to apply AlphaFold to formulating therapeutics for Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis, two of the most deadly diseases in the developing world.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The model can also accurately predict the structures of ligands \u2014 molecules that bind to \u201creceptor\u201d proteins and cause changes in how cells communicate \u2014 as well as nucleic acids (molecules that contain key genetic information) and post-translational modifications (chemical changes that occur after a protein\u2019s created).\n\nAlready, Isomorphic is applying the new AlphaFold model \u2014 which it co-designed with DeepMind \u2014 to therapeutic drug design, helping to characterize different types of molecular structures important for treating disease.\n\nThe pressure\u2019s on for Isomorphic to start generating a profit. In 2021, the company recorded a \u00a32.4 million (~$3 million) loss as it ramped up hiring ahead of opening its second office location in Lausanne, Switzerland."}
