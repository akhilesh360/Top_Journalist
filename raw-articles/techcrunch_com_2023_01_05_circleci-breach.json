Secrets are passwords or private keys that are used to connect and authenticate servers together.\n\nFor projects using API tokens, CircleCI said it has invalidated these tokens and users will be required to replace them.\n\nCircleCI, which in 2021 announced a $100 million Series F at a $1.7 billion valuation, hasn\u2019t shared any more information about the nature of the incident and has yet to respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\n\nHowever, the company is also advising users to audit their internal logs for unauthorized access occurring between December 21, 2022, and January 4, 2023, which suggests the company\u2019s breach began some two weeks earlier. On December 21, the company also announced that it had released reliability updates to the service to resolve underlying \u201csystemic issues.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This saw hackers compromise user data, including usernames and email addresses, usernames and email addresses associated with GitHub and Bitbucket, along with user IP addresses.\n\nIn November, CircleCI said that it had also witnessed an increasing number of phishing attempts whereby unauthorized actors were impersonating CircleCI to gain access to users\u2019 code repositories on GitHub."}
