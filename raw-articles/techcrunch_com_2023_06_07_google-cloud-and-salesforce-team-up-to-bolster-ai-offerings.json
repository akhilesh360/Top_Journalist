The tie-up spans products and services including Google\u2019s BigQuery tooling, Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud and Vertex AI, Google\u2019s fully managed AI platform.\n\n\u201cThis really allows us to democratize AI so that customers get choice on which AI they want to use,\u201d David Schmaier, Salesforce\u2019s chief product officer, told TechCrunch in a phone interview.\n\nIt\u2019s the second such major partnership between Google and Salesforce in recent years. The first, inked in 2017, was largely analytics- and big data-focused. The companies subsequently expanded that original agreement, deepening their data sharing collaborations and building AI-infused customer service experience and marketing tools.\n\nThe move makes sense for Salesforce on its journey to reposition itself as a \u201cdata company.\u201d Over the past several months, Salesforce has introduced new generative AI tools, including EinsteinGPT, an AI assistant for customer relationship management (CRM) tasks like drafting emails, and SlackGPT, which answers natural language questions about a company\u2019s Slack content, servers and channels.\n\nSalesforce is also investing in the broader generative AI ecosystem, no doubt hoping to sniff out the next hit that might bolster its expanding product portfolio. Salesforce Ventures, the company\u2019s corporate investment arm, this March launched a $250 million fund aimed at what it calls \u201cresponsible\u201d generative AI startups.\n\nAs for Google, the renewed partnership with Salesforce puts its big data analytics and AI services front and center \u2014 which isn\u2019t insignificant considering Salesforce\u2019s customer base of over 150,000 organizations.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

At the same time, the company remains third in the U.S. cloud infrastructure market, behind Amazon and Microsoft.\n\n\u201cFrom our point of view, this partnership brings two very large ecosystems of data together and makes it much simpler and easier for customers to get value,\u201d Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nIn terms of what the new strategic partnership will accomplish concretely, Google and Salesforce plan to launch an integration between Data Cloud \u2014 which is essentially a sophisticated data integration layer \u2014 and BigQuery that\u2019ll enable companies to more easily create unified profiles of customers. The integration will provide companies with access across portions of Google and Salesforce\u2019s platforms and clouds, akin to having their data housed in a single location.\n\nElsewhere, new connectors between Data Cloud and Vertex AI will allow companies to bring any AI models they\u2019ve trained or fine-tuned in Vertex across the Salesforce platform. Companies will be able to train and retrain models on customer data from Salesforce, ostensibly streamlining the model development process.\n\nHow might companies actually use the new integrations and connectors? Salesforce provided a few examples in a memo ahead of today\u2019s announcement.\n\nA fashion retailer, for example, could connect CRM data like customer purchase history and service interactions with non-CRM data, such as social media sentiment, to deploy a custom AI model that predicts a customer\u2019s likelihood to buy certain types of clothing based on the data. Or a financial institution could combine CRM and non-CRM data with an AI model to anticipate a customer\u2019s spending habits and investment preferences.\n\nSo, will Google and Salesforce customers actually bite? That\u2019s the perennial question. But Kurian and Schmaier seemed confident in the robustness of the new cross-platform offerings.\n\n\u201cOur general view is, these AI models are going to get richer and richer and much more sophisticated,\u201d Kurian said. \u201cThe result that we\u2019re trying to enable is productivity and efficiency for people doing work, and then, secondly, integrating all the information to make better decisions.\u201d\n\nThe Data Cloud and Google Vertex AI integration will be in pilot starting July 2023 and generally available in October 2023, Google and Salesforce say. As for the Data Cloud and BigQuery integration, it\u2019ll enter pilot in October 2023 and GA in February 2024."}
