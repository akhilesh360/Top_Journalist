Each award includes $150,000 for a total investment of $45 million.\n\nAmong the awardees are a handful of space startups that have also pursued venture capital to fund their businesses. Those include Starfish Space, who received SBIR grant funding to develop its Nautilus in-space docking and capture mechanism, and Argo Space Corporation, for its small reusable spacecraft transfer vehicle called the Argonaut.\n\nNASA issues solicitations for SBIR and STTR proposals annually, with a focus on choosing technologies that align with the agency\u2019s mission requirements. While the grants are relatively small, the SBIR/STTR programs are an important part of the overall space startup ecosystem, Carissa Christensen, CEO and founder of analytics firm BryceTech, explained in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cWinning an SBIR grant, in addition to the resources that it brings in, can connect the company to an agency like NASA, [which] builds relationships, provides access to experts and insight,\u201d she said. The award also acts as a signal that NASA is potentially interested in purchasing this technology in the future, she said, though it\u2019s no guarantee of a contract.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a demand signal that I think is relevant and that I think investors value.\u201d\n\nAmong the businesses highlighted in NASA\u2019s own press release on the news are Huntsville, Alabama\u2013based nou Systems Inc., which is developing a technology to monitor the microbial environment in spacecraft, and HyBird Space Systems, a two-person company developing a retrobraking propulsion system for de-orbiting space junk in low Earth orbit and other applications.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The world\u2019s most successful space company, SpaceX, received millions in government funding to develop its core technologies, including the Raptor rocket engines, Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket \u2014 technologies on which NASA now depends for astronaut transportation, launch and other services.\n\n\u201cNASA has a key role to play in growing the aerospace ecosystem in our country,\u201d Jenn Gustetic, director of early-stage innovation and partnerships for NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in the press release. \u201cThrough these early-stage small business awards, we are inviting more innovators into this growing arena and helping them mature their technologies for not only NASA\u2019s use, but for commercial impact.\u201d\n\nBased on their progress during Phase I, companies have the option to apply for an $850,000 Phase II grant and subsequent Phase III and beyond opportunities."}
