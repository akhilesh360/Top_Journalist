While lithium-ion works fine for consumer electronics and even electric vehicles, battery startup EnerVenue says it developed a breakthrough technology to revolutionize stationary energy storage.\n\nThe technology itself \u2014 nickel-hydrogen batteries \u2014 isn\u2019t actually new. In fact, it\u2019s been used for decades in aerospace applications, to power everything from satellites to the International Space Station and the Hubble Telescope. Nickel-hydrogen had been too expensive to scale for terrestrial applications, until Stanford University professor (and now EnerVenue chairman) Yi Cui determined a way to adapt the materials and bring the costs way, way down.\n\nNickel-hydrogen has a number of key benefits over lithium-ion, according to EnerVenue: it can withstand super-high and super-low temperatures (so no need for air conditioners or thermal management systems); it requires very little to no maintenance; and it has a far longer lifespan.\n\nThe technology has caught the eye of two giants in the oil and gas industry, energy infrastructure company Schlumberger and Saudi Aramco\u2019s VC arm, which together with Stanford University have raised $100 million in Series A funding. The investment comes around a year after EnerVenue raised a $12 million seed. The company is planning on using the funds to scale its nickel-hydrogen battery production, including a Gigafactory in the U.S., and has entered a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Schlumberger for international markets.\n\n\u201cI spent almost three and a half years prior to EnerVenue looking for a battery storage technology that I thought could compete with lithium-ion,\u201d CEO Jorg Heinemann told TechCrunch in a recent interview. \u201cI had essentially given up.\u201d Then he met with Cui, who had managed through his research to bring the cost down from around $20,000 per kilowatt hour to $100 per kilowatt hour within line of sight \u2014 a jaw-dropping decrease that puts it on-par with existing energy storage technology today.\n\nThink of a nickel-hydrogen battery as a kind of battery-fuel cell hybrid. It charges by building up hydrogen inside a pressure vessel, and when it discharges, that hydrogen gets reabsorbed in water, Heinemann explained. One of the key differences between the batteries in space and the one\u2019s EnerVenue is developing on Earth is the materials. The nickel-hydrogen batteries in orbit use a platinum electrode, which Heinemann said accounts for as much as 70% of the cost of the battery. The legacy technology also uses a ceramic separator, another high cost. EnerVenue\u2019s key innovation is finding new, low-cost and Earth-abundant materials (though the exact materials they aren\u2019t sharing).\n\nHeinemann also hinted that an advanced team within the company is working on a separate technology breakthrough that could bring the cost down even further, to the range of around $30 per kilowatt hour or less.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

EnerVenue\u2019s batteries can charge and discharge at different speeds depending on a customer\u2019s needs. It can go from a 10-minute charge or discharge to as slow as a 10-20 hour charge-discharge cycle, though the company is optimizing for a roughly two-hour charge and four- to eight-hour discharge. EnerVenue\u2019s batteries are also designed for 30,000 cycles without experiencing a decline in performance.\n\n\u201cAs renewables get cheaper and cheaper, there\u2019s lots of time of the day where you\u2019ve got, say, a one- to four-hour window of close to free power that can be used to charge something, and then it has to be dispatched fast or slow depending on when the grid needs it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd our battery does that really well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s notable that this round was funded by two companies that loom large in the oil and gas industry. \u201cI think nearly 100% of the oil and gas industry is now pivoting to renewables in a huge way,\u201d Heinemann added. \u201cThey all see the future as, the energy mix is shifting. We\u2019re going to be 75% renewable by mid-century, most think it\u2019s going to happen quicker, and those are based on studies that the oil and gas industry did. They see that and they know they need a new play.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect nickel-hydrogen to start appearing in your iPhone anytime soon. The technology is big and heavy \u2014 even scaled down as much as possible, a nickel-hydrogen battery is still around the size of a two-liter water flask, so lithium-ion will definitely still play a major role in the future.\n\nStationary energy storage may have a different future. EnerVenue is currently in \u201clate-stage\u201d discussions on the site and partner for a United States factory to produce up to one gigawatt-hour of batteries annually, with the goal of eventually scaling even beyond that. Heinemann estimates that the tooling cap-ex per megawatt hour should be just 20% that of lithium ion. Under the partnership with Schlumberger, the infrastructure company will also be separately manufacturing batteries and selling them in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a technology that works today,\u201d Heinemann said. \u201cWe\u2019re not waiting on a technology breakthrough, there\u2019s no science project in our future that we have to go achieve in order to prove out something. We know it works.\u201d"}
