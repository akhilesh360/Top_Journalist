But the founders\u2019 history may have something to do with that. Sal Rehmetullah and Suneera Madhani, who are siblings, also founded another fintech company, Stax Payments. They exited that startup after nearly 10 years when it was valued at north of $1.1 billion, said Madhani, after growing it to over $140 million in recurring revenue and raising $245 million in funding. (Stax still operates but the pair haven\u2019t been part of the business in over two years.)\n\nNow they\u2019re aiming to take their learnings from that experience to grow Orlando, Florida-based Worth, which they say is providing \u201cfrictionless\u201d onboarding and underwriting for SMBs applying for credit-based products, loans, or financing.\n\n\u201cToday, as a consumer you can apply for an Apple Card on your phone and use it minutes later at a coffee shop. It\u2019s instant and seamless. But if you\u2019re a small business applying for the same credit card, financing, merchant services, or a new bank account? That is a different story,\u201d Madhani said.\n\nAnd when a small business applies for financing, credit cards, loans, any financial service or onboarding to enterprises, they often have to complete a cumbersome application process, upload several documents, and wait several days \u2014 and in some cases, weeks \u2014 for a response, she added.\n\nWorth says its technology \u201cfixes\u201d these issues, meaning that SMBs instead face less paperwork, less application abandonment, fewer delays, and faster approvals when applying for credit cards or loans. It claims that it helps entities \u201cquickly and easily\u201d prefill, onboard, and underwrite small businesses with just three fields: their name, address, and tax ID.\n\nIt does this by pre-filling an application with necessary data and automating all the checks a financial institution needs to do, said Rehmetullah. Those checks include Know Your Business (KYB), Know Your Customer (KYC), ownership identity verification, fraud verification, bank account verification, and financial statement analysis in real time. And, Worth says it is able to perform those checks on SMBs and business owners across the globe, not just in the United States.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

By continuously updating it, it\u2019s able to provide financial institutions, credit unions, payment processers, and fintechs with real-time data, said lead investor Neil Kapur, partner of TTV Capital, which led the startup\u2019s equity raise.\n\n\u201cWe have the full 360 financial data of a small business, which has been nonexistent,\u201d Rehmetullah said.\n\nWhile the founders won\u2019t disclose hard revenue figures to date, they told TechCrunch that the startup\u2019s ARR is in the \u201cseven figures,\u201d and that its growth is \u201cexceeding the triple digits,\u201d including adding 12 customers in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone.\n\nWorth currently has over 25 clients, including Aurora Payments, REPAY Holdings, Fairwinds, and PatientFi, among others.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a platform fee for access to pre-filling capabilities, instant verification services, a case management database, ongoing predictive monitoring, and AI-based features. It also charges a per-entity verification usage fee.\n\nLooking ahead, Worth plans to launch a \u201cWorth Score,\u201d or business credit score, to SMBs directly in early 2026 in an effort to help them better understand their financial health.\n\nPresently, Worth has more than 50 full-time employees.\n\nTTV Capital led the equity raise, which also included participation from Ingeborg, Florida Funders, Deep Work Capital, and Florida Opportunity Fund. Worth also secured $5 million in debt funding from Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nWorth plans to use its new capital primarily to scale its organization, particularly across sales and marketing.\n\nTTV\u2019s Kapur believes that Worth is increasing operational efficiency for customers in an automated way, \u201cwhich provides immediate and quantifiably measurable ROI.\u201d His firm also believes that Worth\u2019s founding team \u201cis uniquely qualified\u201d to solve the challenges of onboarding and underwriting for financial institutions.\n\n\u201cTTV is investing in the founders as much as the idea itself,\u201d he told TechCrunch."}
