The termination was first reported by The Verge.\n\nNetflix workers planned the walkout to protest statements that its co-CEO Ted Sarandos made about Dave Chappelle\u2019s recently released special, \u201cThe Closer.\u201d The company claims that it fired the employee in question because the company suspects that they leaked internal information.\n\n\u201cWe have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,\u201d a Netflix representative told TechCrunch. \u201cWe understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.\u201d\n\nThe leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on \u201cThe Closer\u201d that appeared in a story by Bloomberg, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham\u2019s recent comedy special \u201cInside\u201d and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode \u201cSquid Game,\u201d Netflix\u2019s best-ever debut.\n\nEarlier this month, as Netflix prepared to release \u201cThe Closer,\u201d employees raised concerns about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show \u2014 Chapelle goes as far as declaring that he\u2019s \u201cTeam TERF,\u201d referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who conflate gender with biological sex and oppose the movement for transgender rights. When Netflix released the special on October 5 anyway, employees and Netflix subscribers alike lashed out against the streaming service.\n\nThe day after the special\u2019s release, a trans software engineer at Netflix, Terra Field, tweeted a viral thread about the impact of anti-trans rhetoric. \u201cPromoting TERF ideology (which is what we did by giving it a platform yesterday) directly harms trans people, it is not some neutral act. This is not an argument with two sides. It is an argument with trans people who want to be alive and people who don\u2019t want us to be,\u201d Field wrote.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But Field was reinstated the next day after finding that she didn\u2019t try to attend the meeting with ill intent \u2014 in fact, a director had shared the link, leading her to think she could attend. But some Netflix employees were fed up, especially after co-CEO Ted Sarandos wrote in an email to them that \u201ccontent on screen doesn\u2019t directly translate to real-world harm.\u201d He continued, \u201cwe have \u2018Sex Education,\u2019 \u2018Orange Is the New Black,\u2019 \u2018Control Z,\u2019 Hannah Gadsby and Dave Chappelle all on Netflix. Key to this is increasing diversity on the content team itself.\u201d\n\nA lesbian comedian celebrated for her Emmy-winning Netflix special \u201cNanette,\u201d Hannah Gadsby spoke out against Sarandos\u2019 attempt to paint her as a figurehead for queer inclusivity at Netflix.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t pay me nearly enough to deal with the real world consequences of the hate speech dog whistling you refuse to acknowledge, Ted,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cFuck you and your amoral algorithm cult.\u201d\n\nAs Netflix fans the flame by firing an organizer of the upcoming trans walkout, some people are posting links to cancelnetflix.com, which directs users to Netflix\u2019s help page on how to cancel subscriptions.\n\n\u201cWe have been reading all of your comments and using them to continue advocating for bigger and better queer representation,\u201d tweeted Most, Netflix\u2019s LGBTQ+ account. \u201cOk you can go back to yelling at us now.\u201d"}
