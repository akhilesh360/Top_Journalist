But merchants still struggled with low conversion rates because their checkout processes were complicated, and they had to integrate multiple providers for payments, shipping, and loyalty programs.\n\n\u201cI knew there had to be a better way to reduce friction for both merchants and customers,\u201d Lamprou told TechCrunch. So, she thought, why not turn the checkout process into a \u201ccheckout-as-a-service\u201d platform that streamlined it for both merchants and shoppers? She started coding in Python.\n\nBut, she wasn\u2019t alone. Tech giants Shop Pay and Bolt were in the same space, but were focusing on the U.S. market. Europe was less of a focus. Shop Pay, for example, had started back in 2014 and has now raised a total of $982.1 million. So what was Lamprou going to do with her tiny startup, which she\u2019d named Simpler?\n\nShe brought on two friends she\u2019d known from university, Alex Kyriakopoulos and Spyros Mandekis, started building the team, and they raised their first $1 million pre-seed round.\n\nToday, Simpler has over 250 merchants, more than half-a-million registered shoppers, and expects to increase its revenue by 10 times by the end of 2025, said Lamprou. It recently also raised \u20ac9 million (about $10 million) in a pre-Series A round to double down in the U.K., Italy and Spain. Participating in the round were VentureFriends, MMC Ventures and Lamda Development.\n\n\u201cYes, Bolt is a big, massive company, but they are focused on the U.S., mostly with handling fraud problems, like chargebacks. That is a very big problem in the U.S., but it\u2019s not so much in Europe,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Europe, she said, there are different issues: \u201cWe have to localize and add all these different solutions, different providers. Every country has different needs, customer preferences, different payment providers, loyalty coupons, etc.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Despite a temporary decline, the market is expected to keep growing, potentially reaching $955 billion by 2028.\n\nThe solution turned out to be elegant.\n\nOn Simpler, merchants can outsource payments, shipping and loyalty programs into one system, which, the company says, boosts conversions and reduces complexity. For shoppers, it means a one-click buying experience across multiple stores and channels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing strong demand from both SMEs and enterprise-level businesses,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Shop Pay is exclusive to Shopify, Simpler is designed for all platforms. And, unlike Bolt, which focuses heavily on the U.S. market, Simpler is targeting the U.K. and Europe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a robust end-to-end solution with three orders of magnitude less funding than Bolt,\u201d she added."}
