It\u2019s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.\n\nGenerative AI isn\u2019t just about creative endeavors and parlor tricks. Investors and Big Tech alike are betting that it will also affect enterprise infrastructure and cybersecurity, and they are putting money where their mouth is. \u2014 Anna\n\nDev tools plus generative AI\n\nY Combinator Demo Days are a strong indicator of the trends investors might be interested in \u2014 and that\u2019s one of the main reasons why TechCrunch always watches them pretty closely. In its Winter 2023 batch, three areas stood out, the accelerator said: \u201copen source, dev tools and AI.\u201d\n\nDev tools startups in that batch drew particularly strong interest among investors, with four of them raising additional funding just weeks after Demo Day, Insider reported. AI-related startups, on the other hand, were very popular with founders, representing 34% of the winter cohort.\n\nWhile these areas can be looked at separately, I\u2019m more interested in how they might overlap, so I called up Israeli VC Rona Segev to see what she had to say \u2014 not only because Israel has positioned itself as a hotspot for dev tools, but also because almost half of her portfolio involves AI in some form.\n\nSegev, the co-founder and managing partner of VC firm TLV Partners, thinks that generative AI could lead to innovative ways for companies to explore and manage their infrastructure.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\nSegev predicts that the first wave of generative AI applied to improving DevOps would have to do with search. \u201cYou have tons of configurations and different assets, and you want to understand the connections, what they\u2019re doing and what they are.\u2026 It\u2019s hard, [so] an interface to search your infrastructure and get better visibility is a natural kind of extension to what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she told me.\n\nWhile she described better visibility as very important, she expects a lot more to follow. \u201cThe next phase is going to be really managing the infrastructure in a much more intelligent way, which I think is the holy grail of the combination of DevOps and AI.\u201d\n\nAddressing complexity\n\nSegev said that AI might address infrastructure\u2019s complexity, an issue that she thinks is here to stay. \u201cThe complexity of cloud native applications is enormous and exponentially growing.\u201d With huge, complex systems, it becomes almost impossible for the human brain to anticipate what impact a change might have \u2014 and that\u2019s where artificial intelligence might be able to help.\n\nThis still sounded a bit abstract to my only-human brain, so Segev gave me an example: configuration conflicts.\n\n\u201cI think that the next really interesting phase is going to let those very, very strong AI engines help us manage the infrastructure correctly and manage the configuration,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will basically let them know what we want to achieve, and they\u2019ll know how to run all over the infrastructure and modifying chain configuration, and change settings or whatever [is needed] to make it actually workable; something which is becoming harder and harder for us humans to do.\u201d\n\nAs to when this might start to happen, Segev ventured that it might still be three years away. \u201cThis is really delicate, and we need to really trust the AI not to make mistakes.\u201d The overconfidence of a ChatGPT is not what infrastructure management might require, but Segev is hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while, but I think this is going to be a real breakthrough in the future.\u201d\n\n$4.5 billion for generative AI\n\nIf you are curious to know how workers feel about the threats and promises of AI, Kyle Wiggers wrote about two very recent surveys on the topic. The gist is that staffers aren\u2019t necessarily opposed to AI, but they\u2019re still wondering what it might mean for them. Meanwhile, money keeps flowing into the sector:\n\n\u201cAccording to a PitchBook report released this month, VCs have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022. Big Tech has an appetite for the tech, too, with companies like Salesforce pledging hundreds of millions of dollars toward generative AI startups.\u201d\n\nTrend alert?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new trend emerging in the generative AI space \u2014 generative AI for cybersecurity \u2014 and Google is among those looking to get in on the ground floor,\u201d Kyle also wrote this week.\n\nSays Google: \u201cWe have only just begun to realize the power of applying generative AI to security, and we look forward to continuing to leverage this expertise for our customers and drive advancements across the security community.\u201d It\u2019s still early to tell what that might look like beyond Big Tech \u2014 or what the risk-reward balance might look like \u2014 but these developments will definitely be worth watching."}
