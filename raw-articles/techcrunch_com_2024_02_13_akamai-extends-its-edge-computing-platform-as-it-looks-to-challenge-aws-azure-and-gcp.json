This new initiative will increase the company\u2019s cloud-computing network with an additional 10 regions worldwide in the first quarter of this year and then another 75 throughout the rest of the year.\n\nEver since it acquired Linode in 2022, Akamai has made it clear that it intends to build a more comprehensive cloud computing service with a focus on bringing compute capacity close to its users, reducing latency for many traditional use cases and enabling new ones like immersive retail, spatial computing and consumer and industrial IoT. There is, of course, also an AI play here, as Akamai believes that many businesses will want to run their models and other machine learning workloads close to their users.\n\nAWS is taking a similar approach with its Local Zones, but Akamai argues that its competitors treat their cloud and edge networks separately while Gecko is a single, highly distributed cloud platform.\n\n\u201cGecko is the most exciting thing to happen to the cloud in a decade,\u201d said Akamai co-founder and CEO Tom Leighton. \u201cIt\u2019s the next phase of the roadmap toward a more connected cloud we laid out when we acquired Linode to add cost-effective, cloud-native computing capabilities to our portfolio. We began delivering on that roadmap with the launch of Akamai Connected Cloud and the rapid rollout of new core computing regions around the world. With Gecko, we\u2019re furthering that vision by combining the computing power of our cloud platform with the proximity and efficiency of the edge, to put workloads closer to users than any other cloud provider. When we say we operate at planetary scale, this is what we mean.\u201d\n\nGiven its massive network, with over 4,100 points of presence, Akamai also believes that it can differentiate its service through the strength of its network. In addition, the company also argues that a lot of businesses today are looking for a more nimble alternative to the large centralized clouds.\n\n\u201cAkamai is delivering on the promise it made when it acquired Linode by quickly integrating compute into its security and delivery mix,\u201d said Dave McCarthy, IDC, research vice president of Cloud and Edge Services. \u201cWhat they\u2019re now doing with Gecko is an example of the more distributed cloud world we\u2019re heading toward, driven by demands to put compute and data closer to the edge.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to open hundreds of these small regions in the next few years. Though looking at the near term, today it is launching in cities like Hong Kong SAR; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico; Johannesburg; Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; Hamburg, Germany; Marseille, France; and Santiago, Chile, launching later this quarter. That\u2019s on top of the 25 core compute regions it currently offers.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
