The second stage \u201chop\u201d test was a crucial assessment of the vehicle\u2019s avionics, software, and ground systems, as well as the performance of the stage\u2019s unique oxygen-hydrogen rocket engine. Unlike other nozzled engines, the one on Stoke\u2019s second stage is integrated fully with the vehicle and operates as a distributed system, with thrusters that ring the circumference of the second stage.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is a testbed around that premise [of the engine design],\u201d Stoke Space co-founder and CEO Andy Lapsa said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this test program was all about: Does this idea work and can we control the vehicle using some of these new and different techniques?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the questions that we had to ask . . . those are all resounding yeses,\u201d he added.\n\nYesterday\u2019s flight, which took place at Stoke\u2019s test facility near the Grant County International Airport in Moses Lake, Washington, concludes the Hopper prototype development cycle. That means the architecture of that vehicle, which stands at around 6 meters tall and 4 meters in diameter without a payload fairing, is essentially complete.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

(The U.S. Space Force allocated Launch Complex 14 for use by Stoke Space earlier this year.) The 90-odd-person company clearly has its work cut out for them.\n\n\u201cThe first step on our journey was figuring out what a fully reusable upper stage and space vehicle looks like,\u201d Lapsa explained. \u201cWe really believe that it\u2019s hard to build the rest of the vehicle until you know an answer. So that\u2019s why a lot of our focus so far has been on the reusable second stage.\u201d\n\nStill, the company has made remarkable progress since it was founded in 2019. The two founders \u2014 Lapsa and Tom Feldman, CTO \u2014 both worked at Blue Origin before striking off on their own. Over the past four years, the pair has raised around $75 million, including a $65 million Series A led by Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures. With that funding, they\u2019ve put together nearly everything from scratch, including a 21,000-square-foot manufacturing facility and testing infrastructure.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Stoke will conduct its first orbital flight test in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe are pushing really hard to get to orbit by 2025,\u201d Lapsa said. \u201cThere are some interesting opportunities there to do things even before that. That\u2019s our target. We\u2019re going to step back from this a little bit, recalibrate, crystallize our plan. We do have a plan. We\u2019re just going to get more energy behind it and then get back to knocking off milestones.\u201d"}
