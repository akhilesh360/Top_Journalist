Employer.com\u2019s chief marketing officer Matt Charney told TechCrunch the company will revive Bench\u2019s platform and provide instructions for customers to log in and obtain their data.\n\nCustomers will be given the choice to port their data or keep their service under new ownership, Charney told TechCrunch. Bench\u2019s previous recommendation to file for a six-month extension with the Internal Revenue Service to look for a new bookkeeper is no longer needed if customers decide to stay on, Employer.com confirmed.\n\nBench\u2019s website, which is still offline at the time of writing, previously touted more than 35,000 \u201cAmerican small business owners\u201d on its platform, according to an archived copy. (Post-publication, Employer.com told TechCrunch that Bench has approximately 12,000 customers.) Bench\u2019s website currently reads: \u201cMore information on how to continue your services will be available soon.\u201d The startup\u2019s abrupt shutdown on Friday caused chaos, with customers finding themselves locked out of their accounts right as tax season is set to begin, and emails from TechCrunch to Bench employees bouncing back.\n\nTechCrunch confirmed the acquisition with a Bench board member. Neither Bench nor Employer.com would comment on the acquisition price.\n\nEmployer.com is a new company: Its CEO, Jesse Tinsley, announced his acquisition of the domain name in November for about $450,000. Tinsley is behind a host of HR, onboarding, and recruiting-related businesses, including Recruiter.com and BountyJobs. In a post on December 11, Tinsley said that the company is \u201cstill acquiring companies\u201d in the HR space. Employer.com is not VC-backed and is entirely self-funded, Charney told TechCrunch.\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Employer.com said Bench customers can expect to continue \u201cworking with the same expert in-house bookkeepers they know and trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis acquisition ensures that Bench customers can continue relying on the same high-quality service they\u2019ve always received, while also opening the door to future enhancements and capabilities powered by Employer.com\u2019s extensive resources,\u201d Employer.com\u2019s statement said.\n\nThat may be tricky in practice. Bench employed more than 600 people, according to its website, some of whom posted on LinkedIn after the shutdown notice that they were now looking for work. Bench is now starting to call \u201cmany\u201d \u2014 but not all \u2014 of its employees back to work to ensure continuity, Jennifer Bouyoukos, Bench\u2019s chief people officer, told TechCrunch.\n\nTechCrunch archived Bench\u2019s original shutdown notice from December 27 below:"}
