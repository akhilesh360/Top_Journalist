From data collection to crop monitoring and harvesting, robots with eyes are entering the fields.\n\nOne big challenge that remains, however, is implementation: If such solutions are not easy to use, they won\u2019t be used.\n\nBelgian startup Robovision believes it has found a way around that. The company wants to industrialize deep learning tools and make them more accessible to businesses that are not tech companies at their core. It has built a \u201cno-code\u201d computer vision AI platform that doesn\u2019t require software developers or data scientists to be involved at every step of the process. Robovision doesn\u2019t make robots, but as its name suggests, the company also targets robotics companies that want to develop new machines that support AI-enabled automation.\n\nIn practice, this means Robovision customers can use its platform to upload data, label it, test their model and deploy it in production. The company says its model can be useful for a variety of use cases such as recognizing fruit at supermarket scale, identifying faults in newly made electrical components and even cutting rose stems.\n\nOut of its base in Belgium, Robovision already serves customers in 45 countries, CEO Thomas Van den Driessche told TechCrunch in an interview. Now, thanks to a recent sizable funding round, it\u2019s expanding to the U.S., banking on interest from industrial and agribusiness customers in that gigantic market.\n\nThe Series A round of $42 million is being co-led by Belgian agtech investor Astanor Ventures and Target Global. The latter is a Berlin-based investor and its participation in this fundraise marks a departure from some of the other coverage it\u2019s had of late: controversy over its ties to Russian money. Red River West, a French VC that focuses on funding European startups looking to break into North America, also participated in the round.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

This still leaves the founders together with the staff owning more than 50% of Robovision, its chief growth officer, Florian Hendrickx, told TechCrunch via email.\n\nWhat is the point?\n\nOne challenge that Robovision faces in its expansion is that working with different sectors complicates messaging and its go-to-market strategy. On the plus side, learnings and experiments in one application can be applied to another. Robovision, for example, was able to apply some of the 3D deep learning it had developed for disease detection in tulips to disease detection in human lungs during the COVID crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d founder Jonathan Berte told TechCrunch. \u201cIt has been the DNA of Robovision of striking the delicate balance between diversity and focus.\u201d\n\nThat DNA comes from Robovision\u2019s history: It was founded in 2012 as a consultancy studio, and it was several years before it pivoted into the B2B platform approach that also made it more attractive to VCs.\n\nThe initial traction Robovision gained was in agtech, which represents 50% of its activities, Van den Driessche said. Agtech is also where its Series A\u2019s co-lead investor, Astanor, comes from: That company focuses on what it describes as \u201cimpact agrifood.\u201d\n\nAgtech is a sizable opportunity because of labor shortages, and also due to Robovision\u2019s track record \u2014 it helps its partner ISO Group plant a billion tulips annually. But other verticals are growing faster for Robovision, Van den Driessche said.\n\nAccording to Van den Driessche, Robovision is seeing strong traction in life sciences and tech. For instance, Hitachi uses its platform to produce semiconductor wafers. \u201cI don\u2019t think agriculture is going to be the largest sector at scale,\u201d said Bao-Y Van Cong, a partner at Target Global. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be industrial manufacturing.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s recent decision to acquire DarwinAI, an AI startup specializing in overseeing the manufacturing of components, shows rising interest in this space. For Robovision founder Jonathan Berte, it is also a sign that a toolbox that can support a wide variety of different industrialized applications makes more sense. \u201cApple would never [have bought that] company if it were only a point solution.\u201d\n\nFrom Ghent to the world\n\nThe convertible notes that Robovision raised in 2022 and 2023 following its pivot mostly came from Dutch and Belgian investors, but it had to look further afield to raise the capital it needed. The amount of capital that Robovision raised in the round would have been harder to secure from Benelux, or may have required more dilution.\n\nRobovision\u2019s Belgian roots are paying off in other ways. \u201cThe whole early team was very smart people from Ghent university,\u201d Berte said. Van den Driessche became Robovision\u2019s CEO in 2022, and Berte moved his focus to fundraising, partnerships and global expansion.\n\nRobovision\u2019s tech evolution has extended to rethinking the architecture of its computer vision tools in response to customer demand. Because low latency and delivery speed are requirements in certain environments, it launched Robovision Edge.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, doing more with less has become key to competing globally. \u201cI think the only way to do that is to innovate and to become more productive,\u201d Van Cong said."}
