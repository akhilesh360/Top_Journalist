Of those 200 million members, 1.5 million are paying users. More than 20 million games of chess are played every day on the platform.\n\n\u201c[Chess has] got this durability to it,\u201d Albert Cheng, the chief growth officer at Chess.com told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s been played for over 1,500 years, which is just amazing. And even Chess.com is not a brand new company. It\u2019s been around for almost 20 years. It feels really dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe company has expanded a lot since its roots as an online forum for IRL chess players to discuss their matches. Chess.com now offers full chess matches against other people or bots, daily games and puzzles, news about the chess world, the ability to stream chess competitions, and more.\n\nCheng credits the company\u2019s continued product innovation as one of the reasons it has seen strong and sustained growth. For example, the company released an AI game review feature in 2021 \u2014 yes, there is always an AI angle \u2014 that uses AI to summarize how a player did in a game and to flag potential improvements. He added that the majority of new users on Chess.com are beginners, and while the platform is designed for players of all levels, such features can help foster a love for the game for these new members.\n\nThe company has also been able to ride the increased interest in chess over the past few years. Chess, along with many other games, gained a lot of popularity during the pandemic as people looked for online ways to entertain themselves through COVID-19 lockdowns. In response, Chess.com had to bulk up its infrastructure to be able to support the new demand.\n\nNetflix\u2019s chess-focused miniseries, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d further fueled interest when it was released in 2020. Since then, numerous events have sparked new interest in the game. In 2022, the chess world was rocked by a cheating scandal involving five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen. Competitive chess will also be featured in the Esports World Cup for the first time this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
