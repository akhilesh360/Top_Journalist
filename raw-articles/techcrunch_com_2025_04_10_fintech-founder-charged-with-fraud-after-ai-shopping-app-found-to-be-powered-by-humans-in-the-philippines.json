In reality, however, Nate relied heavily on hundreds of human contractors in a call center in the Philippines to manually complete those purchases, the DOJ\u2019s Southern District of New York alleges.\n\nSaniger raised millions in venture funding by claiming that Nate was able to transact online \u201cwithout human intervention,\u201d except for edge cases where the AI failed to complete a transaction. But despite Nate acquiring some AI technology and hiring data scientists, its app\u2019s actual automation rate was effectively 0%, the DOJ claims.\n\nNate\u2019s heavy usage of human contractors was the subject of an investigation by The Information in 2022.\n\nSaniger didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. He is currently listed as a managing partner at New York VC Buttercore Partners, which didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment either.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s indictment says that Nate ran out of money and was forced to sell its assets in January 2023, leaving its investors with \u201cnear total\u201d losses. Albert Saniger\u2019s LinkedIn profile indicates he was no longer CEO as of 2023.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For example, an \u201cAI\u201d drive-through software startup was also powered largely by humans in the Philippines, The Verge reported in 2023.\n\nMore recently, Business Insider reported that an AI legal tech unicorn, EvenUp, used humans to do much of its work."}
