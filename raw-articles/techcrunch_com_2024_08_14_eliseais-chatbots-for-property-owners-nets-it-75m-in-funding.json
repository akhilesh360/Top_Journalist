After graduating, Song moved to New York City, where she took a job as an administrative assistant at a residential real estate firm.\n\nAt the firm, Song saw how inefficiencies in the rental and leasing industry \u2014 particularly inefficiencies around messaging current and prospective tenants \u2014 were contributing to management teams\u2019 exhaustion and burnout, she says.\n\n\u201cRecognizing this challenge, Stoyanov and I began creating AI software to automate communication,\u201d Song told TechCrunch, \u201cand we founded EliseAI in 2017.\u201d\n\nToday, EliseAI employs an army of chatbots to text with, email and respond to calls from renters about things such as apartment tours, maintenance requests, lease renewals and delinquencies. Song says the chatbots are trained on renters\u2019 questions and conversations \u2014 both people looking to lease apartments and current residents \u2014 and are designed to hand off requests to humans automatically where necessary.\n\nImage Credits:EliseAI\n\n\u201cWe only use data that we generated internally,\u201d Song said. \u201cWe do not buy or use external data. This gives us control over the data we use.\u201d\n\nAs a generally privacy-conscious person, I would be wary of texting chatbots like EliseAI\u2019s any personal information \u2014 and volunteering chats for the company\u2019s AI training. So I asked Song about EliseAI\u2019s data retention policies. She said that the company lets users request that their data be deleted, opt out of providing their info for training and, in compliance with laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act, receive a copy of any data that EliseAI has on them.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

According to one reviewer, the chatbots \u2014 which don\u2019t clearly identify themselves as AI \u2014 sometimes fail to loop in managers and agents when they should, and book tours of properties without key info such as a move-in date or phone number.\n\nSong, however, asserts that EliseAI\u2019s chatbots \u201ccontinuously improve their ability to anticipate renter needs,\u201d and on average boost lease tour bookings by 125% while decreasing overdue payments by 50%, according to the company\u2019s internal data.\n\nImage Credits:EliseAI\n\n\u201cOur technology is designed for multifamily and single-family rental owners, operators and third-party property management companies to enhance operational efficiency, reduce tech stacks and costs associated with single-point solutions, increase occupancy, reduce delinquent payments and improve the renter experience,\u201d Song said.\n\nIn addition to the chatbots, EliseAI offers a dashboard where property managers can keep tabs on prospects\u2019 and residents\u2019 requests (e.g. work orders), generate reports on operations and track the progress of renewals. The dashboard comes free with any of EliseAI\u2019s AI products, which the company offers as modules priced according to a software-as-a-service model.\n\nEliseAI competes with vendors including Colleen AI, Funnel, Knock and LeaseHawk. Song says that the company has more than 350 customers, including 70% of the top 50 rental housing operators in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe did not pursue hyper-growth in headcount, instead focusing on controlled hiring and sustainable burn management while continuously investing strategically in revenue growth,\u201d Song said. \u201cWe have observed that funding has remained strong for companies like EliseAI that effectively address enduring enterprise challenges such as operational efficiency, particularly in foundational markets like housing, which are always in demand.\u201d\n\nWith another successful funding round under its belt, EliseAI, which employs around 150 full-time employees out of its NYC offices, plans to further expand into a rather unexpected market: healthcare. Song thinks that much of the company\u2019s tech stack can be adapted to serve health clinics\u2019 administrative needs, like appointment scheduling and billing and payments.\n\nIndeed, EliseAI launched a healthcare solution in 2023 called HealthAI, and Song says that several providers are already using it.\n\nImage Credits:EliseAI\n\nIt\u2019s a crowded market, though; EliseAI will have to compete against startups like Hyro, which similarly use AI to handle text and voice conversations between healthcare organizations and their patients.\n\nSapphire Ventures led the round with participation from Point72 Private Investments, Divco West, Navitas Capital and Koch Real Estate Investments. Bringing EliseAI\u2019s total raised to $140 million, the new capital will be put toward hiring, AI R&D, product development and supporting EliseAI\u2019s go-to-market efforts, Song said.\n\n\u201cOur primary focus was bringing in an excellent partner for the business; that is why we chose Sapphire,\u201d Song added. Sapphire partner Cathy Gao will be joining EliseAI\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cWhile EliseAI is currently the most widely adopted AI platform in this space, the residential real estate market is still in the early stages of leveraging AI to its potential,\u201d Gao said in a statement. \u201cI believe the company is well-positioned to lead the charge in housing and deliver similar results in new verticals like healthcare.\u201d"}
