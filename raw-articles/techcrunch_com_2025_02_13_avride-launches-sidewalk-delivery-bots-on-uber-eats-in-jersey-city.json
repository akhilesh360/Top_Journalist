The ride-hail and delivery giant deploys AVs on its app in 11 cities with six partners, including Cartken, Coco, Nuro, and Serve Robotics; it\u2019s also gearing up to introduce Waymo\u2019s robotaxis to its app in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025.\n\nUber initially announced its partnership with Avride to bring both the company\u2019s delivery bots and its autonomous vehicles to the Uber platform in October 2024. Since then the two have launched robotic deliveries in Austin and Dallas.\n\nThey also plan to launch Avride\u2019s self-driving cars in Dallas this year, which would be Avride\u2019s first robotaxi deployment in the U.S. Avride is a spinout from Yandex, the Russian technology company that devolved its businesses last year as a result of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The startup also recently announced a tie-up with Grubhub to bring bots to university campuses across the U.S., starting with 100 robots at Ohio State University.\n\nJersey City is an interesting, if challenging, choice. Particularly in February, when a mixture of snow, rain, and freezing temperatures could make it difficult for the little bots to make their deliveries.\n\nAvride says its bots can operate in the snow and in \u201cmoderate precipitation.\u201d A spokesperson for the company also noted that while the bots can travel up to five miles per hour with a range of 31 miles on a single charge, their optimal delivery range is within one to two miles.\n\nAvride will operate the bots throughout one square mile of downtown Jersey City, from Hamilton Park to Historic Downtown to the Waterfront, with plans to expand in the future. Avride declined to state how many bots it would put on the streets of Jersey City at launch.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
