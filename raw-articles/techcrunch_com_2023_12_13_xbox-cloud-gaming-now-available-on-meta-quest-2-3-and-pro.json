The Xbox Cloud Gaming app has a beta label, and it\u2019s limited to Quest 2, Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets (sorry OG Quest owners) but it basically delivers a huge-screen virtual cloud gaming experience so long as you have a compatible controller to work with and a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.\n\nI quickly downloaded the app from the Meta Quest store and gave it a test run to see how it works; very well, I\u2019m happy to report, with the caveat that even after pairing both an Xbox Elite 2 controller and an 8bitdo Pro Gamepad I had to hard reboot the headset to get their input to register in the Xbox Cloud Gaming app itself. Once I\u2019d done that, though, everything worked as it should, and I was able to jump into a session of cloud-based GTV V gameplay without incident.\n\nPerformance was smooth on my device, but of course your network environment will factor into how well this works for you. The app doesn\u2019t make your games immersive, I should note: It presents them on a large virtual 2D display, which can be set to one of four sizes (I like XL) and presented in either a fully virtual Xbox-themed environment or in your own space via Meta Quest 3 or Pro\u2019s passthrough modes.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve somehow avoided it, Xbox Cloud Gaming provides a pretty amazing roster of games to check out via Xbox Game Pass, and now you can play them anywhere on a very nice, very large virtual screen if you own a compatible Quest headset and a controller. It\u2019s a pretty nice upgrade for an already excellent service from Microsoft, and a nice additional reason to own a Quest 3, too."}
