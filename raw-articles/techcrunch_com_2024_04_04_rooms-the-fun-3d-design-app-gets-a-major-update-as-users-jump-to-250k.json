Today, the free iOS app is getting a big update that will bring a wave of new discovery-first features, including an activity feed, an explore page, the ability to browse by category, and more.\n\nRooms is an interior decorating app that falls under the cozy game category. Players can build and code intricate 3D rooms and mini-games using a library of over 7,500 digital items. Users can customize items by editing code with Lua, the programming language that\u2019s also used in Roblox Studio.\n\nRooms touts a quarter of a million registered users, up from 40,000 in 2023. The user growth is a notable accomplishment for a scrappy three-person team that released its web platform less than a year ago.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched last November, it was in some ways an experiment to see if this idea we had would resonate with people,\u201d co-founder Jason Toff told TechCrunch. \u201cWe were pleasantly surprised that people not only used it, but that they also made rooms a lot, [and] a lot better rooms than we expected.\u201d\n\nToff previously worked in Google\u2019s AR/VR division. His former colleague Bruno Oliveira is also on the founding team, as well as Nick Kruge, who has experience working at Uber, YouTube, and Smule.\n\nAt launch, the mobile app only had three TikTok-style vertical feeds to choose from: a \u201cFor You\u201d feed, Editor\u2019s Picks, and a Recent feed. However, as Rooms continues to grow, the founders want to give its users a way to easily discover other user-generated rooms and praise creators for their designs.\n\nWith today\u2019s launch of \u201cRooms 2.0,\u201d the company added a Trending feed to the home screen, helping boost popular creators and their most-liked contributions. Plus, users can scroll through over a dozen new categories, including \u201cGames,\u201d \u201cArt,\u201d \u201cFantasy,\u201d \u201cNature,\u201d and \u201cWeird.\u201d There\u2019s also \u201cTribute,\u201d a selection of rooms inspired by popular IPs, such as Minecraft, The Legend of Zelda, Hello Kitty, and others. The feeds were previously curated but now it\u2019s added algorithms that control the order of rooms that appear in the feeds.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Users can tap on different rooms and zoom in or zoom out to see fewer or more designs.\n\n\u201cOur lack of discovery became a hindrance\u2026 Everyone wants their work to be seen. We also heard from creators that they like [discovering] other people\u2019s rooms\u2026 I think it will help a lot to have not just one surface, but dozens of new [feeds] for content to be discovered,\u201d Toff said.\n\nRooms\u2019 new Activity tab lets creators track likes and comments, along with when their room is \u201cremixed\u201d or posted. Each room has an icon at the bottom to indicate its total number of remixes.\n\nThe Remix feature, which allows people to use someone\u2019s design as a template, was also updated to detect copycat rooms, which hopefully prevents creators from imitating someone\u2019s design that took hours to make. (According to the company, 1 in 8 users have spent over two hours editing their rooms.)\n\nUnder the hood, the team implemented a mesh optimization method (which minimizes the complexity of 3D objects) to make large rooms render up to 20 times faster.\n\nThe majority of the updates are on the iOS app, but Rooms is adding the new categories and speed improvements to its web version.\n\nIn the future, Rooms is considering an AI-powered tool to make coding easier on the app. The feature would \u201clook at your code and tell you where there are obvious mistakes,\u201d Toff shared.\n\nAs TechCrunch previously reported, the company was exploring a generative AI feature to help with designing rooms, including the ability to generate images for the walls and floors of a room. Toff said they\u2019re not actively working on that feature due to the high costs. However, in the future, Rooms may offer a premium subscription offering but the company is waiting until the app gets more traction.\n\nRooms will launch a desktop app on Steam in a few months. The company is also considering an Android app but isn\u2019t making it a top priority."}
