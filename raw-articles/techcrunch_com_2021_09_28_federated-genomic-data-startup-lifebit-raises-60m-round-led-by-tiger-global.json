Some estimates suggest that by 2025, 500 million human genomes will have been sequenced, but only a fraction of it is being utilized for drug discovery and precision medicine.\n\nOne of the key startups to emerge in the space is Lifebit, which allows wider access to global biomedical data for drug discovery. It\u2019s now raised a $60 million funding round led by Tiger Global Management. Existing investors Eurazeo, Pentech Ventures and Beacon Capital also participated.\n\nLifebit says it has a patented technology for federating the data around genomic data, allowing researchers to get more insights while keeping the data secure. Privacy issues are regularly raised around genomic data. Let\u2019s face it, it doesn\u2019t get more personal than your genome.\n\nThe company says that rare disease patients are likely to receive an accurate diagnosis up to five times more often when human genetic data is involved in the diagnosis. That\u2019s why these \u201cClinico-genomic\u201d databases can be so transformative.\n\nLifebit has acquired clients across the public and private sectors, including the Hong Kong Genome Project, and an AI-partnership with German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim. It also won the U.K. government contract to power Genomics England.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

People are dying because of how this data is being handled, and making distributed highly sensitive biomedical data usable while keeping it secure in-place and combining it with other data has never been possible, until now.\u201d\n\nPartner at Tiger Global, John Curtius, added: \u201cWe are confident that Lifebit\u2019s innovative and industry-leading software solutions, paired with their customer-first approach, will drive rapid global adoption and accelerate breakthroughs in precision medicine.\u201d\n\nLifebit competes with DNAnexus, Seven Bridges and Iqvia."}
