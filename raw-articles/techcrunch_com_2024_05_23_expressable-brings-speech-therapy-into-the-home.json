But as Sherred observed in the course of her practice, therapists often have limited access to caregivers and face serious educational and tech roadblocks.\n\nIn 2020, around the start of the pandemic, Sherred saw an opportunity to attempt a new, tech-forward speech therapy care model, one that put caregivers \u201cat the center of care\u201d (in her words). She teamed up with Nick Barbara (Sherred\u2019s spouse), Spencer Magloff and Ryan Hinojosa to found Expressable, a platform that offers one-on-one virtual sessions with speech language pathologists.\n\n\u201cLayered on top of Expressable\u2019s synchronous care is a platform that includes multimedia home programming, interactive weekly practice activities, therapist SMS support and more,\u201d Magloff, Expressable\u2019s chief marketing officer, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWith Expressable, speech therapy isn\u2019t limited to one to two times per week, void of caregiver participation.\u201d\n\nExpressable is covered by some insurance plans (including Medicaid) but also offers private pay rates and accepts HSAs and FSAs. It matches patients with speech therapists who might be able to meet their needs and fit their schedules. The matched therapist develops a treatment plan and then regularly meets with the patient and/or their caregiver for online sessions.\n\nImage Credits:Expressable\n\nSome aspects of the plan are designed to be done on the patient\u2019s own time, through Exressable\u2019s self-service platform. Patients and caregivers can track progress week-to-week toward goals and milestones in their individualized plans.\n\nExpressable, which caters to both adult and child patients with conditions ranging from language disorders to speech delays, aphasia, stuttering and autism spectrum disorder, differentiated itself early from many other telehealth startups by hiring its health specialists as W2 employees as opposed to contractors. While this increased Expressable\u2019s medical licensing burden, it positioned the company well to handle challenging speech cases, Magloff says, which often require intensive, years-long treatment plans.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But Expressable is bucking the trend, earlier this week closing a $26 million Series B round led by HarbourVest Partners with participation from Digitalis Ventures, F-Prime Capital and Lerer Hippeau.\n\nWith $50 million in the bank, Expressable plans to make improvements to its care delivery model and core tech, expand its payer relationships and grow its network of therapists as well as its operational team. The company\u2019s also experimenting with various forms of AI, Magloff says.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of relevant AI use cases we\u2019re currently exploring or adapting to improve the client experience,\u201d he added. \u201cThese could help catalog common speech errors, reduce administrative burdens on clinicians and improve operational efficiency.\u201d"}
