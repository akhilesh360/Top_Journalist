Fernando Gadotti struggled with this as the co-founder of DogHero, LatAm\u2019s version of Rover. When Gadotti left the company in 2022, after selling it in 2020, he decided this is where he wanted to focus next.\n\n\u201cEvery time the payroll came around, there\u2019s just a struggle, like it\u2019s dreadful, many hours, just like double-checking data back and forth, and we couldn\u2019t really get any insight that we needed,\u201d Gadotti told TechCrunch. \u201c[We were] pretty much working in the dark, and as we kept growing, it hit me that these problems really weren\u2019t just inconvenient; they\u2019re actually slowing the company down. We\u2019re wasting a lot of time in busy work.\u201d\n\nJust a few months after leaving DogHero, Gadotti started working on S\u00e3o Paulo-based Tako, an employee life cycle platform that automates tasks like onboarding and payroll to save companies time and bring all their employee information into one place. Tako also provides employees with a dashboard to view information and access an interactive paystub meant to increase transparency.\n\nGadotti said that while there are U.S. legacy payroll companies operating in Brazil, like ADP, it makes sense to have a local solution because Brazil\u2019s payment system is quite unique. He said laws around payroll change frequently. There are also 10,000 unions \u2014 companies often have employees in more than one, he said \u2014 that update their rules a few times a year, too, and sometimes have more power than the actual laws.\n\nTako uses an LLM (large language model) to keep up with these constant changes. The LLM ingests the labor law and union law data and digests it so Tako\u2019s developers can keep the code base up-to-date. He said they want to keep humans in the loop to ensure accuracy, but having the LLM get a head start saves a lot of time.\n\nTako launched its product in 2023. Gadotti said that the company processed tens of millions of dollars in payroll as its been operating in stealth but declined to share more details on its customers. Gadotti said the company is currently targeting mid-market white-collar companies with between 100 and 500 employees in the professional and financial service categories.\n\n\u201cThe strategy we took is that we are not trying to boil the ocean,\u201d Gadotti said. \u201cWe want to start in a segment we know before venturing into industrials or more complex areas. We are starting in more simpler segments; as the company evolves, we are going to more complex segments in the future.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The round also included ONEVC and the founders of Ramp. Gadotti said the company plans to put the majority of capital toward research and development in addition to doubling or tripling headcount on its R&D team.\n\nThere are a lot of potential areas that Tako could expand into in the future, like the vast world of employee benefits. Gadotti said the company does plan to expand as it grows into building more features like instant payments.\n\nIn addition to competing with legacy companies like ADP, there are multiple other HR tech startups in the country like Gupy and Caju, which are both more focused on other areas within HR and employee management. But if Tako expands into these areas, which it likely will, these companies could also become strong competitors.\n\nThe name Tako is Japanese for \u201coctopus,\u201d which Gadotti said is how he thinks about the business. Tako\u2019s platform is meant to be the brain of employee data with its tentacles reaching out into different areas of employee management.\n\n\u201cWe want to focus on the whole employee life cycle,\u201d Gadotti said. \u201cWe are constantly listening to our customers\u2019 pain points and where they want us to help them on.\u201d"}
