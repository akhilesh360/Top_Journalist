It looks like the Space Force is taking up their side of that bet, with K2 Space announcing Thursday that its first full satellite mission will fly a number of Department of Defense payloads under a $60 million contract.\n\nThat mission, called Gravitas, will fly no earlier than February 2026. The satellite will fly on SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-16 rideshare mission, where it will carry multiple national security payloads. The spacecraft will conduct operations in low Earth orbit (LEO) before raising its orbit to medium Earth orbit (MEO). MEO, which is between LEO and geosynchronous orbit, has \u201chistorically been an incredibly challenging orbit to operate in,\u201d K2 Space co-founder and CEO Karan Kunjur said in an interview.\n\nTo even get there, spacecraft operators typically either need to equip their satellites with powerful propulsion systems or pay a premium for a launch that takes them directly to the target orbit. Once there, the spacecraft must be capable of surviving the high radiation environment for the duration of the mission. But the Space Force has been building out assets in MEO, primarily for missile tracking and warning, but also to enhance the Global Positioning System (GPS) network.\n\n\u201cMEO offers another level of resilience,\u201d Kunjur said. \u201cIf you think about a multi-orbit strategy or multi-orbit architecture, what you want, if you want resilience, is to have assets that are in LEO, assets that are in MEO, and assets that are in GEO. We really at K2 believe in that future.\u201d\n\nKunjur, who founded the company with his brother Neel, called the contract a \u201cstep change\u201d for the business. The $60 million in funding includes a 1:1:2 mix of government funds, Small Business Innovation Research matching funds, and private funds \u2014 that means $30 million came from private backers, an amount that nearly rivals the startup\u2019s $50 million Series A that closed in February.\n\nVenture investors and the DoD have been pulled in by K2 Space\u2019s proposal for large hardware \u2014 the company\u2019s Mega class satellite features a huge 3-meter-by-3-meter payload bay \u2014 at a cost of less than $15 million per satellite, with lead times of less than three months. These figures represent a paradigm-shifting change from traditional large satellite procurement.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

These include things like reaction wheels, flight computers, solar arrays, and the 20-kilowatt electric propulsion system, which will be among the most powerful to ever fly on orbit. The supply chain for these components at a cost-effective price point simply doesn\u2019t exist, Kunjur said \u2014 which is why K2 Space is setting up those manufacturing lines on its own.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is not only designing it to hit the performance that this mission requires, but also designing it in a way that we can mass produce it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to build one, use it for Gravitas, this mission, and then redesign it for mass production. No, the idea is to build this so that when the first one comes off the line, the second one is right behind it, the third one is behind it, and so on.\u201d\n\nThe company will also fly several technology demonstrators on SpaceX\u2019s upcoming Transporter-12 mission in January, for a mission duration that is expected to last no more than a few months."}
