Revenues increased 72% to $4 billion (\u00a33.1 billion) in the year.\n\nThe message here is one of strong growth overall.\n\nThis is Revolut\u2019s fourth straight year of being in the black. 2024 was a big year for the company \u2014 its net profit more than doubled what it earned in 2023 ($428 million), and it finally secured a banking license in its home market of U.K., which is its biggest. It moved up to a $45 billion valuation on the back of a big secondary share sale. And it launched a crypto exchange, Revolut X.\n\nSome have thought the exchange would be a precursor to Revolut launching its very own stablecoin. From what we understand, it will span multiple jurisdictions beyond Europe and its MiCA crypto region, and it\u2019s taking some time to set up as a result of that complexity.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t break out revenue numbers for Revolut X specifically, but it\u2019s looking like a bit of a juggernaut. The exchange is part of Revolut\u2019s Wealth group, which saw revenue grow 298% to $647 million from just $158 million in 2023. Wealth, which also includes revenue from its savings products, is now the second-largest part of Revolut\u2019s business after the cut it makes on card payments (that business was up 43% to $887 million last year).\n\n\u201c2024 was a landmark year for Revolut,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Nik Storonsky (pictured above), in a statement. \u201cWe not only accelerated our customer growth, welcoming nearly 15 million new users globally, but critically, we also saw customers engaging more deeply by adopting a wider range of our services across both our retail offering and Revolut Business.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Revolut has found it challenging to break into the U.S. market up to now, but the U.S. government\u2019s moves to free up activity around cryptocurrency could pave the way for Revolut to drive up users through the newer products.\n\nThat could also help Revolut close the deal on new financing, too, following reports that it might be approaching another share sale at a $60 billion valuation, on top of launching that stablecoin.\n\nRevolut declined to comment on future secondary fundraises, and was equally non-committal on the subject of a public offering.\n\n\u201cWe have no immediate plans or timeline to announce regarding an IPO,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cOur current focus is firmly on executing our strategy \u2014 driving growth, expanding globally, and continuing to innovate for our customers.\u201d"}
