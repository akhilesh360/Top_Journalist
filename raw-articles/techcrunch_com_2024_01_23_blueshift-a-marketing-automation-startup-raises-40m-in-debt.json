Via the platform, marketers can leverage Blueshift\u2019s AI to segment customers and identify the possible best channels \u2014 and times \u2014 to reach them.\n\nMarketers are increasingly embracing AI, including generative AI, in pursuit of higher consumer \u201cstickiness.\u201d That\u2019s not an ill-advised strategy \u2014 after all, shoppers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences, survey data shows.\n\nFor example, 90% of respondents in a recent Epsilon poll \u2014 consumers ages 18 to 64 \u2014 indicated that personalized experiences were \u201chighly appealing\u201d to them and that they were likely to buy more than 15 products a year from businesses that offered these experiences.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Per Gartner, in 2021, 63% of marketers said that they were struggling with ad personalization tech.\n\nChittoor pitches Blueshift \u2014 and its GenAI suite \u2014 as the solution.\n\nWithin the past year, Blueshift has added capabilities, including customer profile summaries for call center agents and auto-generated, personalized variations of brand marketing content in different tones and styles.\n\nThe cynic in me wonders how accurate this GenAI is \u2014 and whether it\u2019s prone to bias, hallucination and toxicity. But Chittoor, for what it\u2019s worth, asserts that Blueshift takes pains to mitigate algorithmic shortcomings.\n\nBlueshift competes with a number of vendors in the marketing automation space, including several who aim to build solutions from the ground up on GenAI.\n\nWorkMagic, which emerged from stealth in October, provides tools designed to automate marketing tasks for e-commerce retailers. Retail Rocket develops AI-forward tech to retain brand customers. There\u2019s also Pixis, an AI-powered full-stack marketing platform; Aampe, a marketing automation platform for mobile apps; and Connectly, which employs automation to nudge shoppers to complete purchases.\n\nThe struggle for these startups \u2014 and Blueshift, for that matter \u2014 is attracting business away from the incumbents. As of June 2023, HubSpot had a roughly 37% share of the marketing automation market, followed by Adobe (~7%), Oracle (~7%) and ActiveCampaign (~7%).\n\nBut it\u2019s a very lucrative venture, marketing automation. The segment was worth $4.62 billion in 2021 and could reach $13.32 billion in 2030, according to a study from Emergen Research."}
