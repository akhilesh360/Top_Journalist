Council and other hackers took over the SEC\u2019s X account in 2024 to falsely announce that the agency had approved Bitcoin exchange traded funds, or ETFs, which shot up the price of the cryptocurrency before later dropping.\n\nA screenshot of the fake SEC post published by hackers who took over control of the @SECGov X account on January 9, 2024\n\nAccording to the DOJ, Council and his co-conspirators performed a SIM swap attack against the cellphone account of a person who had access to the SEC\u2019s X account, which allowed the hackers to take control of their phone number. From there, the hackers reset the password of the SEC\u2019s X account, granting them control of the account.\n\n"}
