Meanwhile, a new report reveals that 90% of institutional players are either using or planning to use stablecoins. In other news, the US Department of Justice has added 12 more individuals to its list of defendants in a major crypto racketeering case.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial brushes off oversight concerns from Congress\n\nZach Witkoff, one of the co-founders of the Donald Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has rebuffed efforts by US lawmakers to investigate the president\u2019s potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on \u201cfundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.\u201d Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was \u201ctoo busy building\u201d for oversight.\n\n\u201cThe Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,\u201d said the letter. \u201cWhat it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.\u201d\n\nMay 15 letter to Sen. Blumenthal.

Almost half of the respondents (49%) said they already use stablecoins in payments, while 23% are conducting pilot tests and another 18% are in the planning stage.\n\nOnly 10% of institutions surveyed said they were undecided about stablecoin adoption.\n\n\u201cThe stablecoin race has become a matter of avoiding obsolescence as customer demand accelerates and use cases mature,\u201d Fireblocks wrote.\n\nCurrent stablecoin adoption among institutional respondents.

Banks use stablecoins for a competitive advantage, to reduce friction and meet customer expectations.\n\nThe report also found that 58% of traditional banks use stablecoins for cross-border payments, while 28% use the assets to accept payments. Twelve percent of banks use stablecoins to optimize their liquidity, while 9% use them in merchant settlements. Another 9% use them in B2B invoicing.\n\nDOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263 million Bitcoin robbers\n\nAnother 12 people have been charged for their involvement in a $263 million crypto crime spree that stole 4,100 Bitcoin from a Genesis creditor last August, along with a string of break-ins and money laundering.\n\nThe 12 new names, included in a superseding indictment, add to charges originally brought against the main defendant in the case, Malone Lam, on Sept. 19, 2024, the Department of Justice noted in a May 15 statement.\n\n\n\nJeandiel Serrano was named a defendant in the initial indictment but was not included in the superseding one.\n\nThe DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.\n\nMany of the suspects, with aliases like \u201cGoth Ferrrari\u201d and \u201cThe Accountant,\u201d come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22.\n\nThe group allegedly began operating in October 2023, evolving from friends while playing online games to what the DOJ describes as participating in a \u201ccyber-enabled racketeering conspiracy.\u201d"}
