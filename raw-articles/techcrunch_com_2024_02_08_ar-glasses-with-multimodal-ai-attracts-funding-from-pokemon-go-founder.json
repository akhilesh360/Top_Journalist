The glasses have captured the attention and investment of John Hanke, CEO of Niantic, the augmented reality platform behind games like Pok\u00e9mon GO. Brilliant Labs declined to disclose the amount of funding it received from Hanke.\n\nIn a video demo seen by TechCrunch, one of Brilliant Labs\u2019 founders asked Noa through voice for a self-introduction. After about three seconds, the agent generated and projected an answer in text onto the lenses.\n\nIn addition to voice commands, Noa is capable of visual processing, image generation and translation, thanks to the handful of AI models it has integrated: conversational search engine Perplexity AI; Stability AI\u2019s text-to-image model Stable Diffusion; OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generation model GPT4; and the speech recognition system Whisper. Frame\u2019s lenses have a resolution of 640 x 400 for displaying videos and photos.\n\nWith these features, a user shopping at a mall can ask Noa to check the online prices of a pair of shoes they are looking at through Frame, for instance.\n\n\u201cThe future of human/AI interaction will come to life in innovative wearables and new devices, and I\u2019m so excited to be bringing Perplexity\u2019s real-time answer engine to Brilliant Labs\u2019 Frame,\u201d Aravind Srinivas, CEO and founder of Perplexity, said in a statement.\n\nThe question is whether Frame will be responsive enough for any of its AI-generated responses to be helpful. Brilliant Labs\u2019 Bluetooth-enabled devices rely on a smartphone to access the various AI models today. Eventually, though, the founders want to do away with the phone host and embed lightweight machine-learning models directly into the glasses.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

A group of Stanford students once turned the device into a dating assistant that made real-time suggestions on what to say to one\u2019s date.\n\nFrame will continue to be open source like its predecessor, meaning developers will gain access to resources including living documentation, open source codebase and hardware schematics. They will also be able to adjust the parameters of Noa\u2019s supported AI models.\n\nUnlike the bulky Vision Pro, Frame is meant to be worn every day and comes with prescription lenses. Weighing 39 grams and featuring thick round frames made of nylon plastic, the glasses are, as the company puts it, an \u201chomage to the groundbreaking innovations and ideas introduced by figures of history including John Lennon, Steve Jobs and Gandhi.\u201d\n\nFrame will be available for preorder starting today and will retail at $349, the same as Monocle\u2019s price tag. The devices will begin shipping in April.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, Brilliant Labs has managed to attract a lineup of notable angel investors. Back in June, we reported its $3 million investment from Brendan Iribe, co-founder of Oculus; Adam Cheyer, co-founder of Siri; Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble and former partner at Y Combinator; and others. The new capital injection from Hanke brings the firm\u2019s total financing to $6 million."}
