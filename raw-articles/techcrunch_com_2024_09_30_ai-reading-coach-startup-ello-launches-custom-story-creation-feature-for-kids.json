For instance, a story about a hamster named Greg who performed in a talent show in outer space.\n\nKids can select from dozens of prompts, resulting in thousands of combinations.\n\nLike Ello\u2019s regular reading offering, the AI companion \u2014 a bright blue, friendly elephant \u2014 listens to the child read aloud and evaluates their speech to correct mispronunciations and missed words. If kids are unsure how to pronounce a certain word, they can tap on the question mark icon for extra help.\n\nStorytime offers two reading options: one mode where Ello and the reader take turns and another, easier mode for younger readers where Ello does most of the reading.\n\nImage Credits:Ello\n\nAI-assisted story creation for kids isn\u2019t a new concept. In 2022, Amazon introduced its own AI tool that generates animated stories for kids based on various themes and locations, such as underwater adventures or enchanted forests. Other startups, like Scarlet Panda and Story Spark, have also joined in on this trend.\n\nHowever, Ello believes its Storytime offering stands apart due to its proprietary, advanced AI system that adapts to a child\u2019s responses, teaching critical reading skills using phonics-based strategies. The company claims its technology outperforms OpenAI\u2019s Whisper and Google Cloud\u2019s speech API.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For example, if Ello is helping a first-grader practice their \u201cch\u201d sound that week, the AI creates a story that strategically includes the words \u201cchair\u201d and \u201ccheer.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ello, its engineering team implemented safety measures to ensure that the stories are suitable for children. The company spent several months testing the product with teachers, children, and reading specialists. The initial version only permits children to choose from a predetermined set of story options. However, the company envisions a future iteration where children will have even more involvement in the process.\n\n\u201cIf a teacher creates an open story with a child, they provide the [building blocks] through interactive dialog. So, I imagine it would look quite similar to that,\u201d Catalin Voss, co-founder and CTO of Ello, told TechCrunch. \u201cKids prefer some guardrails at some level. It\u2019s the blank paper problem. You ask a five-year-old, \u2018What do you want the story to be about?\u2019 And they kind of get overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Storytime, the company also launched its iOS app a few months ago, expanding the reach of its AI reading coach to even more users. It was previously limited to tablets, including iPads, Android tablets, and Amazon.\n\nWith over 700,000 books read and tens of thousands of families served, Ello is priced at $14.99/month. Meanwhile, families receiving government assistance can access it for just $2.99/month. Ello also partners with low-income schools to offer the subscription at no additional cost.\n\nAdditionally, Ello recently made its library of decodable children\u2019s books online for free."}
