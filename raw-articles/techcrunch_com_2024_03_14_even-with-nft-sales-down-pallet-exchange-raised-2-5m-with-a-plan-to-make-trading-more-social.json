And it\u2019s doing it on a blockchain less known for NFT trading: Sei.\n\nCo-founders Kelvin Wang and Davy Li have convinced investors that there\u2019s still enough of a future in NFTs beyond silly social media profile pictures (PFPs) to have raised a $2.5 million in a private funding round with participation from Spartan Group, Symbolic Capital, Cypher Capital and angel investors from Coinbase, MoonPay and more, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\n\nWang and Li are probably best known for creating The Beacon, one of the most popular web3 games on Arbitrum, a layer-2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum. \u201cThat was the initial impetus, we saw the landscape of games and thought we could build a better game and had a vision of that,\u201d Li said of why they next built an NFT marketplace.\n\nThey see strong promise in the future of NFTs due to human behavior. \u201cThe fundamental draw from a user to trade and flip is very human naturey,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with collectibles, cars and toys.\u201d\n\nWhile building out The Beacon, they saw friction at the marketplace level with speed, transaction time and user experience, so they decided to build a marketplace that was faster and easier to use, Wang said.\n\nIn crypto, platforms are often hyper focused on all things financial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool if there\u2019s a lot of financial innovations happening, but at the same time we saw there\u2019s pain points from a user experience,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for novices to jump in and be hit with numbers and dashboards. Imagine throwing a beginner person who\u2019s never touched stocks into the Bloomberg terminal. It\u2019s like that.\u201d\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It\u2019s using social media tactics like in-app messaging that lets people interested in the same NFT collections engage with each other on its marketplace.\n\n\u201cImagine the moment you purchase an NFT you\u2019re added to a group chat with other holders and there\u2019s a community aspect to it,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe want to roll out certain clans where friends can collaborate and we\u2019re trying to take a page out of the live operation games we see and [create] an enhanced system compared to pure points that a lot of marketplaces use\u201d to gamify the NFT marketplace experience.\n\nAll in all, Pallet wants to be a \u201cgood trading experience for normies,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe want to create a platform that brings liquidity, and regular crypto people and regular users through gamification of social features.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to the largest blockchains in the NFT space, Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana lead the pack with over $1.3 billion in sales volume during the last 30 days, according to CryptoSlam data. So why build a marketplace on a blockchain with less traction?\n\nWell, Sei\u2019s layer-1 blockchain is extremely fast at 12,500 transactions per second and has low gas fees, aka transaction costs. And the team thinks there\u2019s opportunity in its less-chartered territory.\n\n\u201cWe saw it as a parallel to early Solana days. We took a leveraged bet this is going to be the chain of the future because it allows for something Solana wasn\u2019t able to do, tap into the EVM liquidity market in a natural way,\u201d Wang said.\n\nPlus the creators of the Sei blockchain are working on attracting the hoards of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based developers by creating a tech called The Parallel Stack \u2014 something that hopes to make Ethereum faster and less costly.\n\nSei\u2019s EVM work has convinced Pallet that Sei\u2019s overlords will \u201cgrow the pie here,\u201d Wang says.\n\nBetting on Sei, its social aspects and its friendly user interface has paid off so far. Pallet is one of the fastest growing NFT marketplaces by volume growth across all blockchains.\n\nPallet launched in September, and saw a \u201cboom\u201d in December, Wang said. That\u2019s when Seiyans, an Sei-based NFT collection fueled by meme culture, capitulated the new blockchain and marketplace into the talk of the crypto world. Seiyans NFTs can be bought and sold on Pallet.\n\nToday, it has about 99% of NFT market share on Sei and has done over $20 million in trading volume year to date, with over 2 million users visiting its platform this past year, and has 40,000 to 50,000 daily users, Wang said. Its revenue model includes taking a 2% fee on transactions, which brings its annual run rate to $2 million or more, Wang said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great start for us.\u201d\n\nOver the past few weeks, Wang says there\u2019s been a growing interest in art NFTs, collectables that aren\u2019t throwbacks to the whole Bored Apes PFP phenom, although PFPs still have their fans as well. Down the line, Pallet plans to look into working with big partners in the art marketplace and create a separate marketplace for those creators. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put a one-of-one artist with a bunch of PFPs, we want to create unique experiences for both,\u201d Wang said."}
