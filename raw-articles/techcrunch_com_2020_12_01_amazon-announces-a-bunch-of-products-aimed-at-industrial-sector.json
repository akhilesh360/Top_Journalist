That\u2019s because these facilities often have older equipment or proprietary systems that aren\u2019t well-suited to the cloud. Amazon wants to change that, and today the company announced a slew of new services at AWS re:Invent aimed at helping the industrial sector understand their equipment and environments better.\n\nFor starters, the company announced Amazon Monitron, which is designed to monitor equipment and send signals to the engineering team when the equipment could be breaking down. If industrial companies can know when their equipment is breaking, it allows them to repair it on their own terms, rather than waiting until after it breaks down and having the equipment down at what could be an inopportune time.\n\nAs AWS CEO Andy Jassy says, an experienced engineer will know when equipment is breaking down by a certain change in sound or a vibration, but if the machine could tell you even before it got that far, it would be a huge boost to these teams.\n\n\u201c\u2026a lot of companies either don\u2019t have sensors, they\u2019re not modern powerful sensors, or they are not consistent and they don\u2019t know how to take that data from the sensors and send it to the cloud, and they don\u2019t know how to build machine learning models, and our manufacturing companies we work with are asking [us] just solve this [and] build an end-to-end solution. So I\u2019m excited to announce today the launch of Amazon Monotron, which is an end-to-end solution for equipment monitoring,\u201d Jassy said.\n\nThe company builds a machine learning model that understands what a normal state looks like, then uses that information to find anomalies and send back to the team in a mobile app information about equipment that needs maintenance now based on the data the model is seeing.\n\nAmazon has something for those companies that may have a more modern system and don\u2019t need the complete package that Monotron offers. If you have modern sensors, but you don\u2019t have a sophisticated machine learning model, Amazon can ingest this data and apply its machine learning algorithms to find anomalies just as it can with Monotron.\n\n\u201cSo we have something for this group of customers as well to announce today, which is the launch of Amazon Lookout for Equipment, which does anomaly detection for industrial machinery,\u201d he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.
