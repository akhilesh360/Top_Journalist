Continuum Space Systems, a two-year-old startup based in Pasadena, is looking to change that with its unified platform to support the entire life cycle of a space mission.\n\nTo further that goal, Continuum announced today that it had closed a $3 million seed extension round, bringing its total funding raised to date to $6 million. This latest tranche of funding was led by Prophetic Capital Partners, with additional participation from Mandala Space Ventures, Explorer 1 Fund, Freeflow Ventures, and Unlock Venture Partners.\n\nThe company is still receiving interest in the round, which could increase that amount, Continuum CEO Marc Fagan told TechCrunch in a recent interview.\n\nThe startup has close associations with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, the university that founded and manages the lab. Nearly all of Continuum\u2019s employees are from JPL, Fagan said, and the startup\u2019s platform is building upon technology licensed from JPL, though it is not formally affiliated.\n\nOn its website, the company describes its cloud-based platform as one that can see mission management through from \u201cconcept-to-completion.\u201d The platform suite includes simulations for spacecraft design, deployment and operations, and spacecraft performance analysis and is suitable for single-satellite missions or constellations.\n\n\u201cOur platform enables space teams to plan, design and test more effectively throughout the lifecycle of a mission so customers can focus on their main mission priorities,\u201d Fagan said in a statement.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s customers include Radian Aerospace, Accion Systems and the U.S. Space Force."}
