However, government spending on quantum was predicted to hit $40 billion over the next decade. Now a new VC European fund hopes to capitalize on that trend.\n\nThe idiosyncratically named QDNL Participations has reached a \u20ac25 million first close on a proposed \u20ac60 million global fund for early-stage quantum startups.\n\nHowever, QDNL plans to expand outside the country and make investments more internationally.\n\nThe firm\u2019s previous \u20ac15 million fund focused on the Dutch quantum ecosystem, backing startups including Qblox, QuantWare, QphoX, and Q*Bird.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Ton van \u2018t Noordende, general partner at QDNL Participations, said: \u201cQuantum is a global field. There\u2019s been incredible research done in the past decade or so and we\u2019ve seen the emerging of a new, startup ecosystem, with 600 or more companies coming up. There\u2019s also been more than $42 billion invested by over 20 governments in the last two or three years. So this has built up the infrastructure, the clean rooms, the facilities, and essentially de-risking the technology.\u201d\n\nQDNL\u2019s appearance is the latest sign that the Netherlands is making a play to be a key quantum computing ecosystem, and the government (with EU financial backing) has already backed an entire initiative called Quantum Delta NL, which also just happens to be an investor in QDNL.\n\nIts team includes quantum computing pioneer Chad Rigetti as venture partner in the U.S. and specialist quantum VC Kris Kaczmarek in London, who joined as investment director from quantum VC firm 2xN. They join advisors Nadia Carlsten (CEO of the Danish Centre for AI Innovation) and Charles Marcus of the University of Washington.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

But Nvidia did a quick about-turn and announced a quantum-exclusive Nvidia Day at its upcoming event in March."}
