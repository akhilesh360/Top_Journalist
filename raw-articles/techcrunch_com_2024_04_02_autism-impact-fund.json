Both as kids and later in life, these individuals and their families need better detection, treatment and support solutions that will help them live with autism. But until recently, that wasn\u2019t a space that startups and investors ventured into.\n\nAutism Impact Fund (AIF) was a pioneer when it emerged in 2021, three years after the son of its co-founder and managing partner, Chris Male, was diagnosed with ASD. A joint effort of Male and others, AIF strove to become \u201cthe investment and innovation arm of the autism community,\u201d Male told TechCrunch.\n\nSince then, startups in the neurodiversity space gathered momentum, and so did AIF, which recently closed its first fund at $60 million. As a first-of-its-kind fund, exceeding its target is no small feat, especially in an incredibly difficult environment. (The original target was $50 million.)\n\nAIF is a VC fund, not a charity, and Male is also vocal about it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got great collaborations with the nonprofits, with the foundations, and we are very intentional in our regard to drive returns. \u2026 We aim to deliver really strong returns while revolutionizing the status quo for autism and everything in the space through the venture capital model.\u201d\n\nAIF\u2019s limited partners include Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi; Brian Jacobs from Emergence Capital Partners; and Bob Nelsen, a co-founder and managing director of Arch Venture Partners, who also sit on its advisory board. Male didn\u2019t want to tell their personal stories for them, but AIF\u2019s individual backers often have personal connections to autism.\n\nHowever, institutional LPs such as investment firms Fairfield-Maxwell and Ferd also support AIF, \u201cwhich obviously was very helpful to get us to that scale,\u201d Male said. It is also one more sign of change. \u201cThe operators that are entering the space are no longer just family members wanting to help; it\u2019s really sophisticated business operators that are seeing an opportunity to affect wholesale change, and it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nA broad portfolio\n\nSome VC funds wait for a full close to start deploying capital, but not AIF. Because it needed to prove itself and its thesis, it started investing since its first close. With 12 startups in its portfolio, it will start raising its second fund in the next six to nine months, and Male already reports inbound interest.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

For instance, CVS Health Ventures led a $40 million Series D extension round of investment into healthcare startup Cortica in October. Other signals are harder to measure but are still important. Male told TechCrunch that AIF has strong access even to oversubscribed deals, and even when its check is not the largest, there\u2019s a sense that it\u2019s \u201ca stamp of approval to the market and to the community that this is a validated, well-run entity.\u201d\n\nAIF still has resources in its first fund to do a \u201chandful\u201d more deals as well as follow-on investments. After several \u201cstrong bets,\u201d its portfolio is giving it motive to double down. And, Male added, \u201cthere is a very high likelihood of us having exits within the next six months; so, soon, because we [starting deploying] in 2021.\u201d\n\nAIF\u2019s portfolio is already quite diverse, although its website groups companies in two categories: life sciences and data- and tech-enabled services. It also goes beyond the U.S. with Germany-based consulting firm Auticon, which describes itself as an \u201cautism-majority company,\u201d and British telehealth platform Healios. But it will now diversify it further, and not because there isn\u2019t enough deal flow or issues to address with autism alone.\n\nAIF\u2019s decision to broaden its scope has to do with autism itself, Male said.\n\nThe definition of autism is so vague and so broad that there\u2019s really no [biologically precise] understanding of exactly what\u2019s happening, so in order for us to help the individuals as well as the families, we have to broaden that aperture. And it\u2019s behavioral and mental health, it\u2019s all of those but it\u2019s also a broader healthcare issue at lens. The societal cost is in the trillions of dollars right now, and if the rise of incidence increases at the rate it is, it\u2019s $15 trillion societal costs. Lack of employment and being [un]able to work is factored into that. But it\u2019s as if society is sleepwalking into this incredible crisis, for which there is no current plan.\n\nRising awareness\n\nThe fund will now allow itself to invest in \u201cbehavioral health data-driven platforms, innovative healthcare solutions, as well as value-based care frameworks,\u201d and AI is \u201cimpossible to ignore,\u201d Male said. It will also keep on investing in addressing autism comorbidities, for instance gastrointestinal issues. And then there\u2019s the \u201cindependence bucket,\u201d whether that\u2019s employment, financial independence or housing.\n\nThat independence is on the list is a reminder that autism is a spectrum that needs to be addressed as such and that there is a business opportunity for startups that don\u2019t solely focus on kids.\n\nOne startup focusing on adults, neurodiversity employment network Mentra, is backed by Sam Altman and others but not by AIF. No beef there: Mentra partnered with AIF-backed Auticon, and Male called the work they are doing \u201cincredible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s arguably a good sign that AIF isn\u2019t one of Mentra\u2019s investors: The space is getting too big to find the same VC on all cap tables. It\u2019s also global, with health tech Genial Care raising $10 million to help kids with autism and their families in Brazil.\n\nWhen asked if there wasn\u2019t some momentum about company creation in this space recently, Male laughed. Compared to five years ago, he explained, \u201cit\u2019s just fun to see the momentum and the shift.\u201d As the investment side gets busier, too, there will likely be more to come."}
