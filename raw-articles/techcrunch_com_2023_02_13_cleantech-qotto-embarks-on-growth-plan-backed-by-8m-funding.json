Through a pay-to-own model , it avails its products to individuals in sub-Saharan Africa that are off-grid owing to underdeveloped national power grids.\n\n\u201cFor Ivory Coast, due to its consistent pace of development relative to the broader West Africa region, and after having tested and optimized operations and services in Benin and Burkina Faso, Qotto is well prepared for a market entry. Moreover, the customers who have been able to test the Qotto products in the country have expressed a need and desire to see Qotto enter the Ivory Coast market,\u201d said Qotto co-founder and president, Jean-Baptiste Lenoir.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The expansion, to take place by September this year, will happen alongside that of IBL, which is planning \u201cto strengthen its position in East Africa and to develop its renewable energies exposure.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we see a great opportunity for the essential services and large Solar Home Systems offerings provided by Qotto,\u201d said Lenoir.\n\nThe growth bid follows the planned introduction of new products in the market, including financial services and internet access hotspots, as Qotto evolves into an all-rounded essential services operator.\n\n\u201cOur edge is that our presence in rural areas allows us to understand the customers and their needs so that we can propose innovative products based on our technical platform,\u201d he said.\n\nThe planned financial services include micro-insurance, micro-credit and micro-savings products, designed in collaboration with partners such as SUNU, a large insurer in West Africa. Qotto said it has already sold thousands of life insurance contracts.\n\nThe internet hotspots will be located in high foot traffic areas like shops, restaurants or bars.\n\n\u201cIn sub-Saharan Africa, 650 million people do not have access to electricity, 550 million do not have access to the internet and 800 million do not have access to financial services. Many of these customers are overlapping in their needs for off-grid solutions, connectivity and financial services,\u201d said Lenoir.\n\n\u201cOur model helps to solve these critical issues under a single solution \u2014 which we call \u2018essential services,\u2019 backed by our proprietary technology stack. In addition, we are aligned with the SDGs to serve customers and improve impact indicators in our markets,\u201d he said.\n\nRenewable energy solutions by companies like Qotto are bridging the energy access gap in the least electrified countries like South Sudan, Burundi, Chad, Malawi, Burkina Faso, Madagascar and Tanzania, all located in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 75% of the world\u2019s population with no access electricity.\n\nQotto says its revenue has grown 50% year on year, and that it had 11,000 active customers by the end of last year, which it plans to more than double by the close of this year following its growth plans.\n\n."}
