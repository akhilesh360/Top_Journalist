So it \u201ccaptures hundreds of subtle signals about each payment\u201d that other models would miss, she said.\n\nOne use case is improved fraud detection. Stripe\u2019s previous models \u201cgradually\u201d reduced card-testing attacks by 80% over two years. Card-testing attacks are a type of fraudulent activity in which someone tries to determine whether stolen card information is valid so that they can use it to make purchases.\n\nThe company claims that its new foundation model increased its detection rate for such attacks on large businesses \u201cby 64% practically overnight.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cPreviously, we couldn\u2019t take advantage of our vast data. Now we can.\u201d\n\nStripe, of course, isn\u2019t the only fintech to have built a model using AI for fraud detection. Just one example is Sardine, which describes itself as an AI risk platform for fraud, compliance, and credit underwriting, in February raised a $70 million Series C funding round led by Activant Capital.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It just performs better and adapts better to changes in fraud patterns.\n\nStripe also announced on Wednesday its intent to bring stablecoin-backed, multicurrency cards to businesses by partnering with other startups like Ramp, Squads, and Airtm. With such cards, businesses across multiple countries will be able to \u201coperate in the same currency for the first time,\u201d the companies claim.\n\nThe move comes just three months after Stripe completed its acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge.\n\nWith Orchestration, Stripe said it can better help businesses set up, manage, and optimize performance across multiple payment providers from its dashboard \u2014 whether or not they use Stripe as a payment processor.\n\nStripe also used the event to name numerous AI companies that use its billing product, including Windsurf, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Perplexity, and ElevenLabs.\n\nMore recently, according to Vivek Sharma, Stripe\u2019s head of revenue automation, Nvidia migrated its \u201centire subscriber base\u201d to Stripe Billing in six weeks \u2014 a process that the fintech claims typically takes many months for a business to complete and marked the \u201cfastest-ever migration to Stripe Billing.\u201d (Nvidia was already a customer of Stripe Payments.)\n\nOther announcements by Stripe on Wednesday included the following:"}
