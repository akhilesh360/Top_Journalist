The startup declined to disclose its post-money valuation or how much it plans to rake in for the entire Series C.\n\nThe C1 round was led by Taikang Life Insurance, a Chinese insurer, with participation from Qualcomm Ventures and Starlight Capital, an early-stage Chinese investment firm focused on industrial upgrades.\n\nIn 2014, Qualcomm announced that it had committed $150 million to fund Chinese startups advancing mobile technologies for the internet, e-commerce, semiconductor, health and education.\n\nHaving the chipmaking giant onboard will allow ForwardX to \u201cwork with a 5G technology leader to further advance the use of 5G in its smart warehousing and manufacturing projects,\u201d the company said, though the startup is currently using chips from another major supplier.\n\nWith the new financial injection, the Chinese startup plans to accelerate its R&D timeline, ramp up its deployment capabilities in \u201ckey markets\u201d such as the U.S., and expand sales into new markets.\n\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The robot maker so far has accured more than 5 million picks for JD.com\u2019s warehouses, according to Guan.\n\nLike a few other Chinese robotics startups, ForwardX is making a steady foray into overseas markets. It already opened an office in Tokyo, is on course to launch a U.S. branch and plans to enter Europe next year.\n\nThat means it\u2019s coming after its American counterparts like Locus Robotics and 6 River Systems. To compete, the company claimed its solution requires less initial investment than its competitors due to \u201ccompetitive hardware costs and a need for fewer robots per person in its solutions.\u201d Its robots can carry up to 1,200 kilograms of goods each.\n\nAside from selling AMR solutions, ForwardX also touts a fleet management system that can determine how robots roam about within a warehouse, not unlike algorithms used by ride-hailing platforms to optimize driver productivity.\n\nWith help from its lidar- and deep learning-enabled robots, workers can spend more time picking than walking around, and new hires are spared from having to memorize where everything is within the warehouse, Guan explained.\n\nChinese tech companies are increasingly under scrutiny abroad by regulators. From a \u201cbusiness perspective,\u201d Guan doesn\u2019t see how U.S.-China tensions could hobble the firm\u2019s U.S. expansion.\n\n\u201cThere are even fewer people available in the U.S., so robots are what logistics customers need in the U.S.,\u201d she said."}
